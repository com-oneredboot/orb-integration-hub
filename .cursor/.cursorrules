Key directories are `backend/` (Python, AWS SAM), `frontend/` (Angular, TypeScript), `schemas/` (YAML defs, Jinja templates, Python generator), and `docs/` (Markdown docs).

The `schemas/generate.py` script uses Jinja templates from `schemas/templates/*.jinja` to generate Python models (`backend/src/models`), TypeScript models (`frontend/src/models`), GraphQL schema (`backend/infrastructure/cloudformation/`), and DynamoDB CloudFormation (`backend/infrastructure/cloudformation/dynamodb.yml`). Run `python schemas/generate.py` after modifying schemas or templates. See `docs/schema.md` for details."
