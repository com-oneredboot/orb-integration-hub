## Summary

GraphQL schema files are generated without the `AUTO-GENERATED` header that other file types (Python, TypeScript) include. This causes the generator to skip regeneration on subsequent runs with the warning:

```
Skipping apps/api/graphql/schema.graphql: No AUTO-GENERATED header found. Move custom code to lib/ or delete file to regenerate.
```

## Environment

- orb-schema-generator version: 0.13.0
- OS: Linux
- Project: orb-integration-hub

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure `schema-generator.yml` with GraphQL output enabled:
```yaml
output:
  graphql:
    enabled: true
    targets:
      api:
        base_dir: ./apps/api/graphql
```

2. Run `orb-schema generate`
3. Observe the generated `schema.graphql` file starts with:
```graphql
# Generated GraphQL Schema
```

4. Run `orb-schema generate` again
5. Observe warning about missing AUTO-GENERATED header

## Expected Behavior

GraphQL schema files should include the same AUTO-GENERATED header as Python and TypeScript files:

```graphql
# AUTO-GENERATED by orb-schema-generator v0.13.0 - DO NOT EDIT
# Regenerate with: orb-schema generate
```

## Actual Behavior

GraphQL schema files start with:
```graphql
# Generated GraphQL Schema
```

This header doesn't match the pattern the generator checks for, causing it to skip regeneration.

## Workaround

Delete the GraphQL schema file before each regeneration:
```bash
rm apps/api/graphql/schema.graphql
orb-schema generate
```

## Additional Context

Python and TypeScript enum files correctly include the header:
```python
# AUTO-GENERATED by orb-schema-generator v0.13.0 - DO NOT EDIT
```

```typescript
// AUTO-GENERATED by orb-schema-generator v0.13.0 - DO NOT EDIT
```
