# Enhancement: Generate TypeScript GraphQL Query Definition Files

## Summary

The orb-schema-generator currently generates GraphQL schema files (`schema.graphql`) with all Query and Mutation operations, but does not generate the corresponding TypeScript GraphQL query definition files that frontend applications need to execute these operations.

## Current State

- `orb-schema-generator generate` produces `apps/api/graphql/schema.graphql` with all operations
- Frontend TypeScript files in `apps/web/src/app/core/graphql/*.graphql.ts` are **hand-written**
- These hand-written files contain a comment `// Auto-generated by generate.py` but no such script exists
- This creates a maintenance burden and risk of drift between schema and query definitions

## Example of Hand-Written File

```typescript
// apps/web/src/app/core/graphql/Organizations.graphql.ts
// Auto-generated GraphQL operations for Organizations (Lambda)
// Do not edit manually. Generated by generate.py

export const OrganizationsMutation = /* GraphQL */ `
mutation Organizations($input: OrganizationsInput!) {
  Organizations(input: $input) {
    StatusCode
    Message
    Data {
      organizationId
      name
      ...
    }
  }
}
`;
```

## Requested Enhancement

Generate TypeScript GraphQL query definition files that match the generated schema operations. For each entity, generate:

1. **Query operations** - All `QueryBy*` operations from the schema
2. **Mutation operations** - Create, Update, Delete, Disable operations
3. **Proper TypeScript exports** - Named exports for each operation string

### Example Expected Output

For `Organizations`, generate `Organizations.graphql.ts`:

```typescript
// AUTO-GENERATED by orb-schema-generator - DO NOT EDIT

export const OrganizationsQueryByOrganizationId = /* GraphQL */ `
  query OrganizationsQueryByOrganizationId($input: OrganizationsQueryByOrganizationIdInput!) {
    OrganizationsQueryByOrganizationId(input: $input) {
      items {
        organizationId
        name
        description
        ownerId
        status
        createdAt
        updatedAt
        kmsKeyId
        kmsKeyArn
        kmsAlias
      }
      nextToken
    }
  }
`;

export const OrganizationsCreate = /* GraphQL */ `
  mutation OrganizationsCreate($input: OrganizationsCreateInput!) {
    OrganizationsCreate(input: $input) {
      items {
        organizationId
        name
        ...
      }
      nextToken
    }
  }
`;

// ... additional operations
```

## Scope Confirmation Request

Please confirm whether this feature should be implemented for **all supported target languages**:

- [ ] TypeScript (frontend web apps)
- [ ] Python (if applicable for backend GraphQL clients)
- [ ] Dart (if applicable for Flutter apps)

## Benefits

1. **Single source of truth** - Schema YAML files drive all generated code
2. **Reduced maintenance** - No manual sync between schema and query definitions
3. **Type safety** - Generated files always match the schema
4. **Consistency** - Same pattern as other generated artifacts (models, enums, resolvers)

## Configuration Suggestion

Add a new target or option in `schema-generator.yml`:

```yaml
targets:
  - type: typescript-graphql-queries
    output: apps/web/src/app/core/graphql
```

Or extend the existing `web` target to include query generation.
