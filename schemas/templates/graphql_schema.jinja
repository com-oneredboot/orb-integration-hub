"""
Base GraphQL schema.
Generated at {{ timestamp }}.

This schema follows these conventions:
- Type names: PascalCase (e.g., Application)
- Field names: camelCase (e.g., applicationId)
- Input types: PascalCase with Input suffix (e.g., ApplicationRoleInput)
- Response types: PascalCase with Response suffix (e.g., ApplicationRoleResponse)
- List response types: PascalCase with ListResponse suffix (e.g., ApplicationRoleListResponse)
- Query operations: PascalCase with Query suffix (e.g., ApplicationRoleQuery)
- Mutation operations: PascalCase with action suffix (e.g., ApplicationRoleCreate)
- Response fields: PascalCase (e.g., StatusCode, Message, Data)

Authentication is configured per operation using authConfig in the schema files.
Operations can use either API key authentication (@aws_api_key) or Cognito user pool authentication (@aws_auth).
The default is Cognito user pool authentication for the admin group.
