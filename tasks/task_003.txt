# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create GraphQL API Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the GraphQL schema for the Orb Integration Hub API, including types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
# Details:
Design and implement a comprehensive GraphQL schema using AWS AppSync:
1. Define core data types (User, Role, Application, Integration, etc.)
2. Create queries for data retrieval with proper filtering and pagination
3. Define mutations for CRUD operations
4. Set up subscriptions for real-time updates
5. Implement proper input validation

Schema design principles:
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper nullability rules
- Define reusable input and output types
- Document all types, fields, queries, and mutations
- Consider performance implications of nested queries

Implementation steps:
1. Create schema.graphql file with all type definitions
2. Set up AWS AppSync API using the schema
3. Configure authentication and authorization
4. Document the schema with descriptions

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate schema against GraphQL specification
2. Test queries, mutations, and subscriptions with mock data
3. Verify error handling for invalid inputs
4. Test authorization rules for different user roles
5. Performance testing for complex queries
6. Documentation review to ensure all schema elements are properly described
