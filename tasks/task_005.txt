# Task ID: 5
# Title: Design and Implement DynamoDB Data Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the DynamoDB data model to support the application's data storage requirements with proper indexing and access patterns.
# Details:
Design and implement a scalable DynamoDB data model:
1. Define table structures with appropriate partition and sort keys
2. Create Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) and Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs) for query patterns
3. Implement single-table design for related entities
4. Define item schemas and validation

Key tables and indexes:
- Users table (with indexes for email, role, status)
- Roles table (with permissions and hierarchies)
- Applications table (with configuration and integration settings)
- Audit logs table (with time-based and user-based indexes)
- System configuration table

Implementation considerations:
- Optimize for query efficiency and cost
- Implement proper TTL for temporary data
- Consider data size limitations
- Plan for future growth and access patterns
- Implement versioning for schema evolution

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for data access patterns
2. Performance tests for query efficiency
3. Load tests for write capacity
4. Validation tests for data integrity
5. Migration tests for schema evolution
6. Cost analysis for different access patterns
