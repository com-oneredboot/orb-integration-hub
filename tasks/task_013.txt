# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Real-Time Data Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop real-time data synchronization capabilities using WebSockets and GraphQL subscriptions.
# Details:
Create a robust real-time data synchronization system:
1. Implement GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates
2. Create WebSocket server for direct real-time communication
3. Develop event publishing mechanism for data changes
4. Implement client-side subscription handling
5. Add reconnection and state recovery logic

Implementation details:
- Use AWS AppSync for GraphQL subscriptions
- Implement WebSocket API Gateway for direct WebSocket connections
- Create event bus for internal event distribution
- Develop optimistic UI updates for real-time changes
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Add conflict resolution for concurrent updates

Key features:
- Entity-level subscriptions
- Filtered subscriptions based on criteria
- Batch updates for efficiency
- Presence awareness (online/offline status)
- Typing indicators and activity status
- Offline mode and synchronization

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for subscription logic
2. Integration tests for event publishing
3. End-to-end tests for real-time updates
4. Performance tests for high-volume events
5. Reconnection tests for network interruptions
6. Conflict resolution tests
7. Load tests for concurrent connections
8. Latency tests for update propagation
