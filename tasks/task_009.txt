# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Audit Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive audit logging system to track all user and system actions for compliance and troubleshooting.
# Details:
Develop an audit logging system with the following features:
1. Log all user actions (login, logout, data modifications)
2. Track system events and configuration changes
3. Capture relevant context (user, IP, device, timestamp)
4. Implement secure storage and retention policies
5. Create search and filtering capabilities
6. Add export functionality for compliance reporting

Implementation details:
- Use DynamoDB for log storage with time-based partitioning
- Implement log rotation and archiving to S3
- Create standardized log format and schema
- Add middleware for automatic action logging
- Implement proper indexing for efficient queries
- Add log integrity verification

Compliance considerations:
- Ensure logs contain all required fields for compliance
- Implement proper retention policies
- Add tamper-evident features
- Create access controls for log viewing
- Support for log analysis and reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for logging logic
2. Integration tests for log storage and retrieval
3. Performance tests for high-volume logging
4. Verification of log integrity
5. Tests for log rotation and archiving
6. Compliance validation for log content
7. Security testing for log access controls
