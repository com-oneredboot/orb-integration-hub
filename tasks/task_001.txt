# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup AWS Cognito User Pool
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure AWS Cognito User Pool as the centralized authentication service for the Orb Integration Hub, with custom Angular UI for authentication flows.
# Details:
Create and configure an AWS Cognito User Pool with the following settings:
- Enable self-service sign-up
- Configure password policies according to security requirements
- Set up required attributes (email, name)
- Configure MFA options (SMS, TOTP)
- Set up email verification
- Create app clients for different application integrations
- Set up identity providers if needed (social logins)

Implementation steps:
1. Use AWS SDK or CloudFormation to create the User Pool
2. Configure all required settings programmatically
3. Store User Pool ID and App Client IDs in AWS Secrets Manager
4. Document the User Pool configuration for reference
5. Ensure Cognito configuration supports the custom Angular UI authentication flows
6. Verify that backend APIs properly integrate with Cognito for custom auth flows
7. Configure Cognito to work with the custom auth-flow.component that handles account creation, email verification, phone verification, and MFA setup
8. Document the custom user journey and authentication flow

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for User Pool creation and configuration code
2. Integration tests to verify User Pool settings
3. Manual verification of User Pool configuration in AWS Console
4. Test user registration, login, and MFA flows using the custom Angular UI
5. Verify password policies and attribute validation
6. Test email verification process through custom UI
7. Verify that custom UI flows correctly interact with Cognito User Pool
8. End-to-end testing of the complete user journey through the custom auth-flow.component
9. Verify that security requirements are properly enforced in both UI and backend
10. Test that user attributes and MFA settings are correctly synchronized between UI and Cognito
