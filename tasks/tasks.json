It is responsible for routing, executing, and formatting responses for all entity operations.\n\n## Supported Operations\n- **Create**: Insert a new item into a table.\n- **Read**: Retrieve an item by primary key.\n- **Update**: Replace an item (full put) in a table.\n- **Delete**: Remove an item by primary key.\n- **Disable**: Soft-delete by setting `status` to `DISABLED` and adding a `disabledAt` timestamp.\n\n## Operation Routing\n- The Lambda parses the AppSync field name (e.g., `UsersCreate`, `RolesUpdate`) to determine the entity and operation.\n- It uses the `ENTITY_TABLE_ENV` mapping to resolve the correct DynamoDB table.\n\n## Input/Output Patterns\n- **Input**: Each operation expects an `input` object (for create/update) or key fields (for read/delete/disable).\n- **Output**: Returns a JSON object:\n  - `StatusCode`: 200 on success, 500 on error\n  - `Message`: Success or error message\n  - `Data`: The item (for create/read/update/disable) or key (for delete)\n\n## Error Handling\n- On error, returns `StatusCode: 500`, `Message: <error message>`, `Data: null`.\n- If the field is not recognized, returns an error with `StatusCode: 500`.\n\n## Usage Patterns\n- Invoked by AppSync resolvers for all CRUD operations on entities: Users, Roles, Applications, ApplicationUsers, ApplicationRoles, etc.\n- Each entity's CRUD operation is mapped to a Lambda resolver in CloudFormation (see `appsync.yml`).\n\n## Example Response\n```json\n{\n  \"StatusCode\": 200,\n  \"Message\": \"Create succeeded\",\n  \"Data\": { ...item... }\n}\n```\n\n## Special Notes\n- No support for advanced queries (e.g., GSI/LSI queries) or batch operations.\n- All business logic is centralized in this Lambda, which is being replaced by direct resolvers for simplicity and performance.\n\n---\n\nThis documentation is based on the Lambda handler code and the entity schemas. All CRUD operations and their patterns are now captured for migration reference.\n</info added on 2025-05-24T12:32:46.503Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-24T12:34:05.143Z>\n# Correction: Lambda GSI/LSI Query Support\n\nUpon further review of the generated GraphQL files, AppSync CloudFormation, and generate.py, it is clear that the current Lambda-based architecture **does support GSI/LSI (secondary index) queries**. These are exposed as QueryBy... operations (e.g., UsersQueryByEmail, RolesQueryByUserId, ApplicationUsersQueryByApplicationId, etc.).\n\n## Evidence\n- **GraphQL Files**: Numerous QueryBy... operations exist for secondary indexes (e.g., UsersQueryByEmail, UsersQueryByCognitoId, RolesQueryByUserId, etc.).\n- **AppSync CloudFormation**: Resolvers are defined for these QueryBy... fields, all routed to the DynamoDbCrud Lambda.\n- **generate.py**: The codegen logic emits QueryBy... operations for all primary and secondary indexes.\n\n## Updated Documentation Note\n- The Lambda is invoked for all CRUD and QueryBy... operations, including those that use GSIs/LSIs.\n- The migration plan must ensure that all GSI/LSI queries are supported by the new direct resolvers.\n\n---\n\nThis correction is now recorded in the subtask documentation.\n</info added on 2025-05-24T12:34:05.143Z>",

Entity Schema Review\n- All entity schemas (Users, Roles, Applications, ApplicationUsers, ApplicationRoles) use `type: dynamodb` and define primary and secondary indexes (GSI/LSI) in a compatible way for direct DynamoDB resolvers.\n- Field types are simple (string, number, boolean, array, timestamp) and map directly to DynamoDB and GraphQL types.\n- No complex nested objects or unsupported types detected in current schemas.\n\n## 2. Generated GraphQL Schema Review\n- All CRUD and QueryBy... operations are present for each entity, including GSI/LSI queries (e.g., UsersQueryByEmail, RolesQueryByUserId).\n- Input/output types are flat and suitable for direct VTL mapping.\n- Response types follow a `{ StatusCode, Message, Data }` pattern, which can be replicated in VTL.\n\n## 3. Gaps or Special Cases\n- No multi-table transactions or computed fields requiring Lambda detected.\n- All current operations can be mapped to direct DynamoDB resolvers.\n- If future schemas introduce nested objects or require aggregation, additional VTL or Lambda logic may be needed.\n\n## 4. Mapping Lambda Operations to Direct Resolvers\n- Each Lambda-based operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Disable, QueryBy...) has a direct DynamoDB equivalent:\n  - Create → PutItem\n  - Read → GetItem\n  - Update → UpdateItem/PutItem\n  - Delete → DeleteItem\n  - Disable → UpdateItem (set status, disabledAt)\n  - QueryBy... → Query (with GSI/LSI as needed)\n- All of these can be generated by `generate.py` and Jinja templates.\n\n## 5. Required Updates to Codegen\n- `generate.py` must:\n  - Emit direct DynamoDB resolver resources for all CRUD and QueryBy... operations.\n  - Use new/updated Jinja templates for VTL request/response mapping.\n  - Ensure all index-based queries (GSI/LSI) are supported.\n  - Generate response mapping templates that wrap results in `{ StatusCode, Message, Data }`.\n- Jinja templates must:\n  - Cover all DynamoDB operations (PutItem, GetItem, UpdateItem, DeleteItem, Query).\n  - Handle error cases and return the standard response format.\n\n## 6. Output\n- All current schemas are compatible with direct DynamoDB resolvers.\n- No manual resolver or schema editing is required; all changes can be handled by `generate.py` and Jinja templates.\n- Future schema changes should be reviewed for compatibility, especially if introducing nested objects or advanced logic.\n</info added on 2025-05-24T12:37:16.336Z>",

      "description": "Implement the SMS Verification feature by refactoring the existing PhoneVerification to SmsVerification across the entire stack, including schema updates, Lambda modifications, AppSync integration, and frontend changes.",
      "details": "This task involves a comprehensive refactoring and feature implementation across multiple layers of the application:\n\n1. **Schema/Model Refactoring**:\n   - Rename `PhoneVerification` to `SmsVerification` in all schema definitions\n   - Update field names to follow PascalCase convention consistently\n   - Modify GraphQL schema types, inputs, queries, and mutations\n   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition period\n\n2. **Lambda Function Updates**:\n   - Refactor the verification Lambda to use the new naming convention\n   - Update response structure to return all fields in PascalCase format\n   - Enhance error handling and validation for SMS verification\n   - Implement proper logging for verification attempts and outcomes\n\n3. **AppSync Integration**:\n   - Update resolvers to work with the new schema definitions\n   - Modify mapping templates to handle the PascalCase field names\n   - Ensure proper data transformation between Lambda and client\n   - Test resolver performance and error handling\n\n4. **Frontend Implementation**:\n   - Update all frontend components that interact with verification\n   - Modify form components to handle SMS verification flow\n   - Update TypeScript interfaces and models to reflect schema changes\n   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback\n   - Create responsive UI for verification code entry\n\n5. **Security Considerations**:\n   - Implement rate limiting for SMS verification attempts\n   - Add proper validation for phone numbers (E.164 format)\n   - Ensure secure handling of verification codes\n   - Add expiration for verification codes\n\n6. **Configuration Updates**:\n   - Update environment variables and configuration settings\n   - Configure SMS service provider integration\n   - Set up monitoring for SMS delivery and verification success rates",
      "testStrategy": "The testing strategy will verify the SMS verification feature works end-to-end:\n\n1. **Unit Testing**:\n   - Test Lambda function with various input scenarios (valid phone, invalid phone, etc.)\n   - Verify proper PascalCase field naming in responses\n   - Test schema validation for new SmsVerification types\n   - Validate frontend components in isolation\n\n2. **Integration Testing**:\n   - Verify AppSync resolvers correctly handle the new schema\n   - Test data flow between frontend, AppSync, and Lambda\n   - Validate error handling across the stack\n   - Test backward compatibility with existing code\n\n3. **End-to-End Testing**:\n   - Create automated E2E tests for the complete verification flow\n   - Test on multiple devices and screen sizes\n   - Verify SMS delivery and code validation (using test SMS provider)\n   - Test edge cases like resending codes, expired codes, etc.\n\n4. **Manual Testing**:\n   - Perform user acceptance testing with real devices\n   - Verify SMS delivery timing and reliability\n   - Test the user experience of the verification process\n   - Validate accessibility of the verification UI\n\n5. **Performance Testing**:\n   - Measure response times for verification requests\n   - Test system under load with multiple concurrent verifications\n   - Monitor Lambda execution times and AppSync performance\n\n6. **Security Testing**:\n   - Verify rate limiting functionality\n   - Test for common security vulnerabilities\n   - Ensure verification codes are properly secured",
