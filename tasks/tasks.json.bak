      "details": "This task involves extracting the existing schema/code generator functionality from generate.py and associated templates into a properly structured Python package named 'orb-schema-generator'. The implementation should include:\n\n1. Package Structure:\n   - Create a proper Python package structure with setup.py, README, documentation\n   - Organize code into logical modules (core generation, templates, CLI interface)\n   - Implement proper dependency management\n\n2. Features:\n   - Command-line interface (CLI) for standalone usage\n   - Programmatic API for integration into other Python applications\n   - Template management system that allows for customization\n   - Configuration options for different output formats and targets\n   - Integration hooks for Task Master/MCP workflows\n\n3. Migration Steps:\n   - Refactor the current generate.py code to be more modular\n   - Extract template handling into a dedicated component\n   - Create abstraction layers for input/output operations\n   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing usage patterns\n\n4. Documentation:\n   - Installation instructions (pip install, development setup)\n   - Usage examples for CLI and programmatic API\n   - Template customization guide\n   - Integration guide for Task Master/MCP\n   - Contributing guidelines\n\n5. Publishing:\n   - Package the code for PyPI distribution\n   - Set up CI/CD for automated testing and publishing\n   - Version the package appropriately (semantic versioning)\n\nThe package should maintain all current functionality while making it more accessible, configurable, and maintainable for use across multiple projects.",
      "testStrategy": "Testing for this task should be comprehensive and include:\n\n1. Unit Tests:\n   - Test each component of the package independently\n   - Verify template rendering with various inputs\n   - Test CLI argument parsing and execution paths\n   - Validate configuration handling and defaults\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Test the package as installed via pip\n   - Verify it works when imported into another Python project\n   - Test CLI functionality end-to-end\n   - Validate MCP integration workflows\n\n3. Compatibility Tests:\n   - Ensure the package works with the existing codebase\n   - Verify that generated output matches previous implementation\n   - Test with different Python versions (3.7+)\n\n4. Documentation Tests:\n   - Verify all examples in documentation work as described\n   - Test installation instructions on clean environments\n   - Validate API documentation against actual implementation\n\n5. Acceptance Criteria:\n   - Package can be installed via pip install orb-schema-generator\n   - CLI commands work as documented\n   - Existing projects can migrate to using the package with minimal changes\n   - New projects can easily integrate the package\n   - Task Master/MCP integration is functional\n   - All tests pass in CI environment\n   - Documentation is complete and accurate\n\n6. Performance Benchmarks:\n   - Compare performance metrics before and after extraction\n   - Ensure no significant performance regression\n\nThe testing process should include automated tests that can be run in CI/CD pipelines as well as manual verification of integration points and documentation accuracy.",
