# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement AWS AppSync Resolvers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop resolvers for the GraphQL API to connect with backend data sources and implement business logic.
# Details:
Create AppSync resolvers for all GraphQL operations:
1. Implement resolver mapping templates for DynamoDB data sources
2. Create Lambda resolvers for complex business logic
3. Implement direct Lambda resolvers for custom operations
4. Set up HTTP resolvers for external API integrations

Resolver implementation details:
- Use VTL (Velocity Template Language) for DynamoDB resolvers
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Optimize for performance (batch operations, pagination)
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Add logging for debugging and monitoring

Specific resolvers needed:
- User management (create, update, delete, query)
- Role management (assign, revoke, query)
- Application registration and configuration
- Integration setup and management
- System configuration and monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for resolver logic
2. Integration tests with actual data sources
3. Performance testing for resolver efficiency
4. Error handling tests with invalid inputs
5. Authorization tests to verify proper access control
6. End-to-end tests for complete API operations
