# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Protocol Adapters
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create protocol adapters for REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket to enable integration with various external systems.
# Details:
Implement protocol adapters for different integration types:

1. REST Adapter:
- Support for standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request/response transformation
- Authentication handling (Basic, OAuth, API Key)
- Error mapping and handling
- Rate limiting and retry logic

2. GraphQL Adapter:
- Query construction and execution
- Schema mapping and validation
- Authentication integration
- Error handling and mapping
- Subscription support

3. WebSocket Adapter:
- Connection management
- Message formatting and parsing
- Authentication and session handling
- Reconnection logic
- Event mapping

Implementation details:
- Create modular, pluggable adapter architecture
- Implement common interface for all adapters
- Add configuration options for each adapter type
- Create logging and monitoring hooks
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for adapter logic
2. Integration tests with mock external systems
3. Performance tests for throughput and latency
4. Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
5. Security tests for authentication handling
6. Load tests for concurrent connections
7. End-to-end tests with actual external systems
