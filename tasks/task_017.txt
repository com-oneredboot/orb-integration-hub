# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement System Monitoring and Health Checks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive system monitoring solution with health checks, alerts, and dashboards.
# Details:
Develop a robust monitoring and health check system:
1. Implement service health checks for all components
2. Create system metrics collection and storage
3. Develop alerting and notification system
4. Build monitoring dashboards for admins
5. Implement performance tracking and analysis

Implementation details:
- Use AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logs
- Implement custom health check endpoints
- Create dashboard using appropriate visualization tools
- Set up alerting thresholds and policies
- Implement historical metrics analysis
- Add proactive monitoring for potential issues

Key monitoring areas:
- API performance and availability
- Authentication service status
- Database performance and capacity
- Integration endpoint availability
- Error rates and patterns
- User activity and system load
- Security events and anomalies

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for health check logic
2. Integration tests for metrics collection
3. End-to-end tests for alerting
4. Performance tests for monitoring overhead
5. Validation tests for dashboard accuracy
6. Fault injection tests for alert triggering
7. Load tests to verify monitoring under stress
