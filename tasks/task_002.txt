# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a role-based access control system that integrates with AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive RBAC system with the following components:
1. Define role schema in YAML with permissions and hierarchies
2. Implement role assignment to users in Cognito (using custom attributes or groups)
3. Create permission validation middleware for API requests
4. Implement role-based UI rendering for frontend

Role types to implement:
- Business Owner (full access)
- Administrator (system configuration, user management)
- Integration Specialist (manage integrations)
- End User (application access only)

Implementation details:
- Store role definitions in DynamoDB
- Use Cognito groups for basic role assignment
- Implement fine-grained permissions in application logic
- Create helper functions for permission checking

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for role and permission validation logic
2. Integration tests for role assignment and retrieval
3. End-to-end tests for permission enforcement
4. Test cases for each role type and permission boundary
5. Security testing to verify proper access control
6. Performance testing of permission validation
