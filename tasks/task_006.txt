# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Authentication Flows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the complete authentication flow including registration, login, password reset, and MFA setup.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive authentication flows using AWS Cognito:
1. User registration with email verification
2. Login with username/email and password
3. Multi-factor authentication setup and validation
4. Password reset and account recovery
5. Session management and token handling
6. Account linking and social login integration

Implementation details:
- Use Cognito SDK for authentication operations
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Create secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- Implement logout and session invalidation
- Add security features (device tracking, suspicious activity detection)

User experience considerations:
- Minimize friction in authentication flows
- Provide clear error messages and guidance
- Implement progressive MFA enrollment
- Support remember-me functionality
- Ensure mobile-friendly authentication

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication logic
2. Integration tests with Cognito
3. End-to-end tests for complete authentication flows
4. Security testing for token handling
5. Usability testing for authentication UX
6. Edge case testing (network issues, timeouts, etc.)
7. Accessibility testing for authentication forms
