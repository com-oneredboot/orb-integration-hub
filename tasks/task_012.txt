# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Plugin System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an extensible plugin system to allow for custom integrations and functionality without modifying the core codebase.
# Details:
Implement a flexible plugin system with the following features:
1. Plugin discovery and registration
2. Versioning and compatibility checking
3. Configuration management for plugins
4. Lifecycle hooks (install, activate, deactivate, uninstall)
5. Dependency management between plugins
6. Security and isolation

Implementation details:
- Define plugin interface and contract
- Create plugin registry and management API
- Implement plugin loading and initialization
- Add configuration schema validation
- Create plugin marketplace or repository
- Implement plugin health monitoring

Plugin types to support:
- Integration plugins (for external systems)
- Authentication plugins (for custom auth providers)
- UI plugins (for custom dashboards and widgets)
- Workflow plugins (for custom business logic)
- Data transformation plugins (for custom transformations)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for plugin management logic
2. Integration tests for plugin loading and execution
3. Security tests for plugin isolation
4. Performance tests for plugin overhead
5. Compatibility tests for version management
6. Error handling tests for plugin failures
7. End-to-end tests with sample plugins
