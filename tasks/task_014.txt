# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Event-Driven Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an event-driven workflow system to automate processes and respond to system and user events.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive event-driven workflow system:
1. Create event definition and registration mechanism
2. Implement workflow designer and configuration
3. Develop workflow execution engine
4. Add conditional logic and branching
5. Implement action handlers for various operations
6. Create monitoring and debugging tools

Implementation details:
- Use AWS Step Functions for complex workflows
- Implement simple workflows directly with Lambda functions
- Create event bus for event distribution
- Develop workflow templates for common scenarios
- Add error handling and retry logic
- Implement workflow versioning and history

Key workflow capabilities:
- User provisioning and deprovisioning
- Approval processes
- Data synchronization between systems
- Scheduled tasks and batch operations
- Notifications and alerts
- Data validation and enrichment

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for workflow components
2. Integration tests for workflow execution
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance tests for workflow throughput
5. Error handling tests for workflow failures
6. Tests for concurrent workflow execution
7. Regression tests for workflow templates
