# Auth Flow Creation Changelog

## 2025-03-07

### Initial Setup
- Created feature branch `auth-flow-creation-feature`
- Set up feature context and documentation
- Initialized feature development

### Architecture Implementation
- Created directory structure for refactored authentication flow components
- Implemented password reset functionality in Cognito service
- Enhanced auth state management with additional steps for password reset
- Created main auth container component with proper component structure
- Implemented login and password components with responsive UI

### Code Standardization
- Created scripts to add standardized file headers to all files
- Implemented template headers for TypeScript, Python, and HTML files
- Added consistent file headers with path, author, date, and description across codebase
- Set up automation to maintain header standards in future development
- Fixed HTML headers to use proper HTML comment format instead of JavaScript/TypeScript style comments

### UI Improvements
- Removed duplicate "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons from the home page
- Streamlined navigation by removing redundant call-to-action buttons
- Simplified user flow by consolidating authentication entry points

### Error Handling
- Created a comprehensive error registry system with unique alphanumeric error codes
- Implemented structured error objects with codes, descriptions, and solutions
- Fixed authentication flow issue with GraphQL email check by properly typing UserQueryInput
- Improved error messaging with contextual information for better user experience
- Added systematic error logging with detailed context for debugging
- Enhanced type safety with proper TypeScript typings and type guards
- Fixed potential TypeScript errors with proper interface definitions and type checking
- Resolved index signature access errors (TS4111) with proper property access patterns
- Added readonly modifiers to interface properties for better type checking

### Code Analysis
- Reviewed the existing auth-flow component implementation
  - Current component handles too many responsibilities (monolithic)
  - Uses NgRx with basic store structure in place
  - Implements multi-step authentication process with Cognito
  - Has minimal error handling and user feedback
  - Missing password reset functionality
  - No clear separation of concerns between login/registration flows

- Analyzed current authentication services:
  - `CognitoService`: Handles AWS Cognito authentication operations
  - `UserService`: Manages user-related operations and database interactions
  - Services need better error handling and proper typed responses
  - Services need better documentation
  - Missing password reset service methods

### Implementation Plan

1. Refactor Auth Flow Architecture:
   - Break down monolithic auth-flow component into smaller, focused components
   - Implement proper routing for different authentication steps
   - Create dedicated components for each auth step

2. Enhance State Management:
   - Refine existing NgRx store structure for better state organization
   - Add missing action types for password reset
   - Improve error handling in effects
   - Add selectors for derived state

3. Missing Functionality:
   - Implement password reset flow
   - Add account recovery options
   - Enhance error messaging and user feedback

4. Component Structure:
   - Create container/presentational component pattern
   - Implement shared form components for reuse
   - Create dedicated route guards for auth flow steps

### Initial Implementation Tasks
1. Create directory structure for refactored components
2. Implement password reset functionality in services
3. Enhance the state management with additional actions and effects
4. Create basic UI components for each auth step

### Technical Decisions
- Will use NgRx for state management of authentication
- Authentication UI will follow Angular Material design patterns
- Will implement lazy loading for auth module components
- Will adopt a container/presentational component pattern for better testability

### SMS Configuration Updates
- Streamlined IAM roles for SMS functionality
- Added proper SNS permissions to CognitoSMSRole
- Removed unnecessary SNS permissions from LambdaRole
- Added SnsRegion configuration to UserPool
- Updated CloudFormation template with optimized role structure

### SNS Permissions Fix
- Added missing SNS permissions to CognitoSMSRole:
  - CreateTopic, SetTopicAttributes, GetTopicAttributes
  - Subscribe, ConfirmSubscription
- Added broader SNS resource permissions for subscription operations
- Fixed CloudFormation deployment error with SNS permissions

### SNS Publish Permissions Update
- Added sns:Publish permission to all SNS resources
- Fixed remaining SNS permission error in CloudFormation deployment
- Updated IAM role policy to allow publishing to any SNS topic

### Changes Since Last Update
```
[Add commit hash after deployment] - Fix SNS publish permissions for Cognito SMS functionality
```

### Files Changed
```
infrastructure/cloudformation/cognito.yml
```

### Technical Decisions
- Dedicated CognitoSMSRole for SMS operations
- Scoped SNS permissions to specific verification topic
- Removed redundant permissions from LambdaRole
- Added region specification for SMS operations
- Added comprehensive SNS permissions for topic management and subscriptions
- Added broad sns:Publish permission to support SMS functionality
