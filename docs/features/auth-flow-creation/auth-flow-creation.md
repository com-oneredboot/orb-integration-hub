# Auth Flow Creation Context

## Feature Overview
- Implement a comprehensive authentication flow for user login, registration, and account management
- Create a seamless user experience for authentication processes including sign-up, login, password reset
- Support role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Success criteria: Users can register, login, reset password, and access appropriate resources based on their role

## Technical Approach
- Leverage AWS Cognito for authentication and user management
- Implement Angular components for auth UI with responsive design
- Create state management for auth using NgRx to maintain session state
- Develop guards for protected routes based on authentication status
- Connect with backend APIs via GraphQL for user data

## Dependencies
- AWS Cognito service integration
- Angular material components for UI elements
- NgRx for state management
- GraphQL APIs for user data fetching/updating

## Implementation Details
- Key files to be modified:
  - User service (`frontend/src/app/core/services/user.service.ts`)
  - Auth guards (`frontend/src/app/guards/auth.guard.ts`)
  - AppSync API configurations
  - User models

- Current auth-flow component analysis:
  - Existing implementation in `/frontend/src/app/features/user/components/auth-flow/`
  - Uses NgRx for state management with basic store structure
  - Implements a multi-step authentication process with following steps:
    - Email input
    - Password verification/setup
    - Email verification
    - Phone setup/verification
    - MFA setup/verification
  - Has form validation and error handling

- Enhancements needed:
  - Refactor into smaller, more maintainable components
  - Improve the auth state management
  - Add password reset functionality
  - Enhance error handling and user feedback
  - Implement proper loading states and transitions
  - Fix any existing bugs in the auth flow

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for authentication services and components
- Integration tests for full auth flow
- Mock Cognito services for testing
- Test scenarios for various auth states and error conditions

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure Cognito user pool is properly configured
- Configure proper environment variables for different environments
- Verify CORS settings for API calls
