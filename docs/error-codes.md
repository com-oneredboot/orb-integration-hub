## Best Practices

1. **Error Code Usage**
   - Always use predefined error codes from the registry
   - Do not create new error codes without updating this documentation
   - Use the most specific error code available

2. **Error Handling**
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Include error codes in user-facing messages
   - Provide clear, actionable solutions

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Provide fallback behavior when possible
   - Maintain user state during error recovery

4. **Documentation**
   - Update this document when adding new error codes
   - Include examples of error handling in code comments
   - Document error recovery strategies

## Adding New Error Codes

When adding new error codes:
1. Choose the appropriate category
2. Use the next available number in that category
3. Update this documentation
4. Add the code to the `ErrorCode` type in `error-registry.model.ts`
5. Add the error definition to the `ERRORS` constant
6. Update any relevant tests
