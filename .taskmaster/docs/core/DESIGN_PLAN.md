   - Multiple protocol support (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Extensible plugin system

2. **Security & Compliance**
   - Enterprise-grade security
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging
   - Data encryption
   - Compliance monitoring

3. **Performance & Scalability**
   - High throughput
   - Low latency
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing
   - Caching strategies

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React + TypeScript for admin interface
- Material-UI components
- Redux for state management
- GraphQL client (Apollo)
- Real-time subscriptions

### Backend
- AWS AppSync for GraphQL API
- Lambda functions for business logic
- DynamoDB for data storage
- EventBridge for event handling
- CloudWatch for monitoring

### Infrastructure
- CloudFormation templates
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery
- Security controls

## Component Design

### Core Components
1. **API Gateway**
   - GraphQL schema management
   - Request validation
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling

2. **Integration Engine**
   - Protocol adapters
   - Data transformation
   - Routing logic
   - Error recovery
   - Performance optimization

3. **Admin Interface**
   - Integration management
   - Monitoring dashboard
   - Configuration UI
   - User management
   - Audit logs

## Data Model

### Integration Definition
```typescript
interface Integration {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: IntegrationType;
  config: IntegrationConfig;
  status: IntegrationStatus;
  metadata: {
    created: string;
    updated: string;
    version: string;
  };
}
```

### Connection
```typescript
interface Connection {
  id: string;
  sourceId: string;
  targetId: string;
  type: ConnectionType;
  config: ConnectionConfig;
  status: ConnectionStatus;
}
```

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**
   - Cognito user pools
   - JWT token validation
   - MFA support
   - Session management
   - API key management

2. **Authorization**
   - IAM roles and policies
   - Fine-grained permissions
   - Resource-level access
   - Audit logging
   - Security monitoring
