# Critical Security Fixes for Auth-Flow Feature

## Project Overview
This PRD outlines critical security vulnerabilities identified in the authentication system that require immediate remediation to prevent credential exposure, injection attacks, and security breaches.

## Problem Statement
The current authentication system has several critical security vulnerabilities:
1. **Hardcoded credentials** in environment files expose production secrets in source code
2. **Missing rate limiting** allows brute force attacks and SMS flooding
3. **Insufficient input validation** creates injection attack vectors
4. **Inadequate test coverage** for security components leaves vulnerabilities undetected

## Security Requirements

### 1. Credential Security (CRITICAL)
- Remove all hardcoded production credentials from environment.ts and environment.prod.ts
- Implement secure environment variable injection for all sensitive configuration
- Ensure production builds fail without required environment variables
- Document environment variable requirements for deployment

### 2. Rate Limiting Protection (HIGH)
- Implement rate limiting for SMS verification endpoints
- Add phone number-based rate limiting with configurable time windows
- Include proper error responses and security event logging
- Monitor rate limit violations for security incidents

### 3. Input Validation & XSS Prevention (HIGH)
- Add comprehensive email format validation with proper regex
- Implement phone number format validation (E.164 standard)
- Add verification code format validation
- Implement XSS prevention and input sanitization across all auth forms

### 4. Security Test Coverage (HIGH)
- Create comprehensive test suite for CognitoService with security focus
- Add AuthGuard unit tests covering all security scenarios
- Implement SMS verification Lambda function security tests
- Create auth effects integration tests with error scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Zero hardcoded credentials in source code
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (max 5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- All inputs validated and sanitized
- >90% test coverage for security components
- Security scan passes with no high/critical findings

## Timeline
- Critical fixes (credentials): Immediate (within 24 hours)
- High priority fixes: Within 1 week
- Test coverage: Within 2 weeks

## Risk Assessment
- **Without fixes**: High risk of credential theft, brute force attacks, injection vulnerabilities
- **With fixes**: Significantly reduced security risk, improved compliance posture
