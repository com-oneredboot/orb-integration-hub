Please conduct a comprehensive UX/UI engineering review of my "auth-flow" feature from the perspective of a senior UX/UI engineer. I need a thorough analysis covering both user experience design and front-end implementation quality.

**User Experience Analysis:**
- User journey mapping and flow efficiency
- Cognitive load and decision-making friction
- Error messaging clarity and helpfulness
- Progressive disclosure and information hierarchy
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
- Mobile responsiveness and cross-device experience
- Loading states, micro-interactions, and feedback mechanisms
- Recovery paths and error handling UX

**Authentication Flow Usability:**
- Registration process complexity and completion rates
- Login experience optimization (social login, remember me, etc.)
- Password requirements and strength indicators
- Password reset flow intuitiveness
- Multi-factor authentication UX (if implemented)
- First-time user onboarding and guidance
- Returning user recognition and personalization

**Visual Design & Interface:**
- Design system consistency and component reusability
- Typography hierarchy and readability
- Color contrast and visual accessibility
- Form design best practices (field validation, input states)
- Button placement, sizing, and interaction states
- Loading indicators and progress communication
- Brand alignment and trust-building elements

**Front-End Implementation Quality:**
- Component architecture and reusability
- CSS organization and maintainability
- Performance optimization (bundle size, lazy loading)
- Animation performance and smoothness
- Form validation implementation (client-side UX)
- Responsive design implementation quality
- Cross-browser compatibility considerations

**Technical UX Considerations:**
- Client-side state management for auth flows
- Caching strategies for improved performance
- Offline capability and graceful degradation
- SEO considerations for public-facing auth pages
- Analytics and user behavior tracking implementation
- A/B testing infrastructure and conversion optimization

**Security UX Balance:**
- Security measures that don't compromise usability
- Trust indicators and security communication
- Biometric authentication integration (if applicable)
- Session management UX (timeout warnings, seamless renewal)

Please provide:
1. UX audit summary with priority levels (Critical UX Issues, Major Improvements, Minor Enhancements)
2. Specific UI/UX problems with screenshots or component references
3. Detailed improvement recommendations with implementation approach
4. Design system gaps and inconsistencies
5. Accessibility violations and remediation steps
6. Performance bottlenecks affecting user experience
7. Conversion optimization opportunities
8. Modern UX patterns and industry best practices we should adopt

Focus on both immediate user pain points and strategic UX improvements that could increase conversion rates and user satisfaction. Include specific implementation guidance for front-end improvements.
