# Auth Flow Creation Changelog

## 2025-03-07

### Initial Setup
- Created feature branch `auth-flow-creation-feature`
- Set up feature context and documentation
- Initialized feature development

### Architecture Implementation
- Created directory structure for refactored authentication flow components
- Implemented password reset functionality in Cognito service
- Enhanced auth state management with additional steps for password reset
- Created main auth container component with proper component structure
- Implemented login and password components with responsive UI

### Code Standardization
- Created scripts to add standardized file headers to all files
- Implemented template headers for TypeScript, Python, and HTML files
- Added consistent file headers with path, author, date, and description across codebase
- Set up automation to maintain header standards in future development
- Fixed HTML headers to use proper HTML comment format instead of JavaScript/TypeScript style comments

### UI Improvements
- Removed duplicate "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons from the home page
- Streamlined navigation by removing redundant call-to-action buttons
- Simplified user flow by consolidating authentication entry points

### Error Handling
- Created a comprehensive error registry system with unique alphanumeric error codes
- Implemented structured error objects with codes, descriptions, and solutions
- Fixed authentication flow issue with GraphQL email check by properly typing UserQueryInput
- Improved error messaging with contextual information for better user experience
- Added systematic error logging with detailed context for debugging
- Enhanced type safety with proper TypeScript typings and type guards
- Fixed potential TypeScript errors with proper interface definitions and type checking
- Resolved index signature access errors (TS4111) with proper property access patterns
- Added readonly modifiers to interface properties for better type checking

### Code Analysis
- Reviewed the existing auth-flow component implementation
  - Current component handles too many responsibilities (monolithic)
  - Uses NgRx with basic store structure in place
  - Implements multi-step authentication process with Cognito
  - Has minimal error handling and user feedback
  - Missing password reset functionality
  - No clear separation of concerns between login/registration flows

- Analyzed current authentication services:
  - `CognitoService`: Handles AWS Cognito authentication operations
  - `UserService`: Manages user-related operations and database interactions
  - Services need better error handling and proper typed responses
  - Services need better documentation
  - Missing password reset service methods

### Implementation Plan
> **Note**: This implementation plan has been migrated to Taskmaster tasks. See `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` for current task breakdown:
> - **Task #1**: Setup AWS Cognito User Pool (with 5 subtasks)
> - **Task #23**: SMS Verification Feature (with 6 subtasks)

Historical implementation plan (now managed in Taskmaster):
- âœ… Refactor Auth Flow Architecture (covered in Task #1.3)
- âœ… Enhance State Management (implemented)
- ðŸ”„ Missing Functionality (Task #1.3, #1.4, #1.5)
- âœ… Component Structure (implemented)

### Technical Decisions
- Will use NgRx for state management of authentication
- Authentication UI will follow Angular Material design patterns
- Will implement lazy loading for auth module components
- Will adopt a container/presentational component pattern for better testability

### SMS Configuration Updates
- Streamlined IAM roles for SMS functionality
- Added proper SNS permissions to CognitoSMSRole
- Removed unnecessary SNS permissions from LambdaRole
- Added SnsRegion configuration to UserPool
- Updated CloudFormation template with optimized role structure

### SNS Permissions Fix
- Added missing SNS permissions to CognitoSMSRole:
  - CreateTopic, SetTopicAttributes, GetTopicAttributes
  - Subscribe, ConfirmSubscription
- Added broader SNS resource permissions for subscription operations
- Fixed CloudFormation deployment error with SNS permissions

### Explicit SNS Publish Permissions
- Added dedicated statement for sns:Publish on verification topic
- Separated SNS permissions into distinct statements for better clarity
- Fixed remaining SNS permission error in CloudFormation deployment

### Comprehensive SNS Permissions Update
- Added all required SNS permissions for Cognito SMS functionality:
  - ListTopics, DeleteTopic, AddPermission, RemovePermission
  - SetEndpointAttributes, GetEndpointAttributes
  - ListSubscriptionsByTopic
- Added separate statement for ListTopics with wildcard resource
- Fixed remaining SNS permission error in CloudFormation deployment

### Changes Since Last Update
