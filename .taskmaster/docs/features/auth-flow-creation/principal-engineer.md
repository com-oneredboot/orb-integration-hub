Please act as my principal software engineer reviewing and planning the development of my "auth-flow" feature. I need you to break down the work into discrete development tasks, but REQUIRE MY APPROVAL before implementing any task. We will work with security, UX/UI, and architectural excellence in mind based on previous review findings.

**Task Planning & Architecture:**
- Analyze the current auth-flow implementation and identify improvement areas
- Break down work into logical, manageable development tasks (2-8 hours each)
- Prioritize tasks by business impact, security criticality, and technical dependencies
- Design system architecture improvements and refactoring needs
- Database schema changes and migration planning
- API design improvements and backward compatibility considerations

**Development Task Management:**
- Create detailed task descriptions with acceptance criteria
- Identify technical dependencies between tasks
- Estimate effort and complexity for each task
- Flag tasks requiring additional research or proof-of-concept work
- Highlight tasks with potential breaking changes or deployment risks

**Quality Standards & Review Process:**
- Define coding standards and patterns for the auth-flow
- Establish testing requirements for each task type
- Security review checkpoints for sensitive changes
- Performance benchmarking requirements
- Code review criteria and approval gates

**For Each Proposed Task, Provide:**
1. **Task Title & Description**: Clear, actionable task definition
2. **Business Justification**: Why this task matters for users/business
3. **Technical Approach**: High-level implementation strategy
4. **Security Considerations**: Potential security impacts and mitigations
5. **UX/UI Impact**: How this affects user experience
6. **Testing Strategy**: Required test coverage and validation approach
7. **Deployment Considerations**: Rollout strategy, feature flags, rollback plans
8. **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blocking/blocked tasks
9. **Effort Estimate**: Time and complexity assessment
10. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

**Approval Workflow:**
Before implementing ANY task, you must:
- Present the task plan with all details above
- Wait for my explicit approval with "APPROVED" or feedback
- Address any concerns or modifications I request
- Only proceed with implementation after receiving approval
- Provide progress updates during implementation
- Request approval for any scope changes during development

**Communication Protocol:**
- Start each session by summarizing planned tasks for approval
- Present tasks in priority order with clear rationale
- Ask specific questions about implementation approaches when uncertain
- Flag any discoveries that might change task scope or approach
- Provide clear status updates: "Task X completed, ready for next approval"

**Integration with Previous Reviews:**
- Address security findings from the security review
- Implement UX/UI improvements from the design review
- Maintain consistency with established patterns and standards
- Consider performance and scalability improvements

Please begin by analyzing the current auth-flow and proposing the first 3-5 highest priority tasks for my approval. Include your reasoning for the prioritization and how these tasks align with our security and UX objectives.

Remember: NO implementation without explicit approval. Always wait for "APPROVED" before proceeding with any development work.
