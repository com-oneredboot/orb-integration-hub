# Admin Interface Feature

## Feature Overview
- Create a comprehensive admin interface for user and system management
- Implement role-based access control for administrative functions
- Provide system configuration and monitoring capabilities
- Success criteria: Administrators can manage users, configure system settings, and monitor system health

## Technical Approach
- Leverage AWS Cognito User Pool for admin authentication
- Implement Angular Material components for admin UI
- Use NgRx for state management of admin functions
- Create reusable admin components and services
- Implement real-time monitoring capabilities

## Current State
- Schema and API layer implemented:
  - Applications management (CRUD operations)
  - Application roles management
  - Application users management
  - Roles management
  - Users management
- GraphQL operations follow consistent naming:
  - Query operations: `[entity]QueryById`
  - Mutation operations: `[entity]Create`, `[entity]Update`, `[entity]Delete`
- Authentication and authorization:
  - Admin group in Cognito User Pool
  - API Key for unauthenticated access
  - `@aws_auth` directives on operations

## Dependencies
- AWS AppSync for GraphQL API
- AWS Cognito for admin authentication
- DynamoDB for data storage
- Angular Material for UI components
- NgRx for state management

## Implementation Details
### Backend Components (Implemented)
- Data Models:
  - Applications
  - ApplicationRoles
  - ApplicationUsers
  - Roles
  - Users

- GraphQL Operations:
  ```graphql
  # Example for Applications
  applicationsQueryById(input: ApplicationsQueryInput!): ApplicationsResponse
  applicationsCreate(input: ApplicationsCreateInput!): ApplicationsResponse
  applicationsUpdate(input: ApplicationsUpdateInput!): ApplicationsResponse
  applicationsDelete(id: ID!): ApplicationsResponse
  ```

### Frontend Components (To Be Implemented)
- Admin dashboard
- User management interface
- System configuration panel
- Monitoring and analytics dashboard
- Role and permission management

### Technical Requirements
- Role-based access control implementation
- Real-time system monitoring
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Configuration management system
- User management capabilities

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for admin components and services
- Integration tests for admin workflows
- Security testing for admin access
- Performance testing for monitoring features

## Deployment Considerations
- Separate admin routes and components
- Secure admin API endpoints (implemented via Cognito)
- Implement audit logging
- Configure proper environment variables
- Set up monitoring alerts
