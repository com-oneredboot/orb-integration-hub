# Organizations Feature - Expert Kickoff Meeting
**Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Feature:** Organizations and Application Management System  
**Branch:** organizations-feature  
**Status:** Requirements Gathering Phase

## Feature Overview

The Organizations feature introduces a comprehensive multi-tenant system for managing customer organizations, applications, environments, and user roles. This feature enables customers to create organizations, invite users, manage applications across environments, and handle notifications.

## Core Concept Summary

- **Organizations:** Customer-owned entities with hierarchical user management
- **Applications:** Environment-specific application management (prod/stage/test)
- **User Roles:** Multi-level role management across organizations and applications
- **Notifications:** System-wide notification management with acknowledgment tracking

## <ï¿½ Proposed Data Model

### Organizations Table
- **Hash Key:** organizationId
- **Range Key:** userId  
- **Fields:** createdAt, updatedAt, name, description

### OrganizationUsers Table
- **Purpose:** Link Organizations to Users with roles
- **Roles:** member, administrator, owner

### Applications Table
- **Hash Key:** applicationId
- **Range Key:** environmentId
- **Purpose:** One-to-one connection of customer applications per environment

### ApplicationUsers Table
- **Purpose:** Link environmentId and userId with roles from ApplicationRoles
- **Features:** Environment-specific role assignments

### Notifications Table
- **Hash Key:** userId
- **Range Key:** notificationId
- **Features:** TTL 7 days post-acknowledgment

## = Expert Review Questions

Below are comprehensive questions from each expert perspective to ensure we develop a robust PRD:

## = DevSecOps Engineer Questions

### Security & Infrastructure Concerns:

1. **Multi-Tenancy Security:**
   - How do we ensure proper data isolation between organizations in DynamoDB?
   - What row-level security mechanisms will prevent cross-organization data access?
   - Should we implement organization-scoped encryption keys?

2. **Access Control:**
   - How will we enforce the role hierarchy (owner > administrator > member) at the API level?
   - What happens if an owner leaves an organization? Who inherits ownership?
   - How do we prevent privilege escalation attacks across organization boundaries?

3. **Invitation Security:**
   - How do we secure the invitation process to prevent unauthorized organization access?
   - What validation occurs to ensure invited users are legitimate customers?
   - How do we handle invitation token security and expiration?

4. **Data Residency & Compliance:**
   - Will organizations in different regions require data to stay within specific boundaries?
   - How do we handle GDPR/CCPA compliance for organization data deletion?
   - What audit logging is required for organization and application management actions?

5. **Infrastructure Scaling:**
   - How will DynamoDB handle potential hot partitions with organization-based queries?
   - What's the expected scale (organizations, users per org, applications per org)?
   - Do we need GSIs for efficient querying patterns?

6. **Application Environment Security:**
   - How do we ensure production environment access is more restricted than dev/staging?
   - What approval workflows are needed for production access requests?
   - How do we audit and log environment-specific access changes?

### Architecture & Technical Implementation:

1. **Data Model Design:**
   - Why use organizationId+userId as composite key instead of separate Organization and OrganizationMembership tables?
   - How will we efficiently query "all organizations for a user" vs "all users in an organization"?
   - What GSIs are needed for optimal query performance?

2. **Relationship Management:**
   - How do we handle cascading deletes (organization deletion, user removal, etc.)?
   - What happens to applications when an organization is deleted?

4. **State Management:**
   - How will the frontend manage organization context switching?
   - What caching strategy for organization and application data?
   - How do we handle real-time updates for role changes and notifications?

5. **Migration Strategy:**
   - How do we migrate existing customers to the organization model?
   - What's the rollback plan if we need to revert the feature?
   - How do we handle existing customer data during transition?

6. **Performance Considerations:**
   - What's the expected read/write ratio for organization operations?
   - How do we optimize for the most common query patterns?
   - What caching layers are needed for frequent organization lookups?

7. **Error Handling:**
   - How do we handle partial failures in multi-table operations?
   - What retry mechanisms for invitation and notification workflows?
   - How do we ensure data consistency across related tables?

## <ï¿½ Senior UX/UI Engineer Questions

### User Experience & Interface Design:
