PROJECT: Security Vulnerability Remediation - January 2025

OVERVIEW:
Address critical and high-priority security vulnerabilities identified by Dependabot alerts across the monorepo. This includes npm packages in frontend/package-lock.json and root package-lock.json, as well as Python packages in various Pipfile.lock files.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Fix all critical severity vulnerabilities (3 npm packages)
2. Fix all high severity vulnerabilities (7 issues, primarily tar and axios)
3. Address moderate severity vulnerabilities in production dependencies
4. Update development dependencies with security issues
5. Ensure no regression in functionality after updates

REQUIREMENTS:

Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required):
- Fix Prototype Pollution in minimist (#40) - package-lock.json
- Fix Arbitrary Code Execution in underscore (#35) - package-lock.json
- Fix Path Traversal in decompress (#34) - package-lock.json

High Severity Vulnerabilities:
- Fix multiple tar package vulnerabilities (#44, #43, #39, #38, #37, #32) - package-lock.json
- Fix axios SSRF and Credential Leakage (#31) - frontend/package-lock.json

Moderate Python Vulnerabilities:
- Fix urllib3 redirect control issues (#48, #47, #29, #28, #8, #5) - multiple Pipfile.lock files
- Fix requests .netrc credentials leak (#46, #7, #4) - multiple Pipfile.lock files

Moderate NPM Vulnerabilities:
- Fix tough-cookie Prototype Pollution (#42) - package-lock.json
- Fix Server-Side Request Forgery in Request (#41) - package-lock.json
- Fix Prototype Pollution in Ajv (#36) - package-lock.json
- Fix Prototype Pollution in minimist (older CVE) (#33) - package-lock.json
- Fix Axios Cross-Site Request Forgery (#30) - frontend/package-lock.json

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- NPM vulnerabilities: Update package-lock.json and frontend/package-lock.json
- Python vulnerabilities: Update Pipfile.lock in backend/, schemas/, and backend/src/layers/stripe/
- Run security audits after updates
- Test all functionality after dependency updates
- Document any breaking changes or required code modifications

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All critical and high severity vulnerabilities resolved
- Moderate vulnerabilities in production dependencies resolved
- No regression in application functionality
- Passing security audits for both npm and pip
- Updated lock files committed to repository
