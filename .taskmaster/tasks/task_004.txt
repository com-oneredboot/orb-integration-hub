# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive RBAC system with role definitions, permission management, and authorization enforcement across all API endpoints and UI components
# Details:
Implement RBAC system with: 1) Role hierarchy supporting Business Owner, Admin, Developer, and End User personas, 2) Fine-grained permissions for all system operations, 3) Dynamic role assignment and permission checking, 4) Authorization middleware for GraphQL resolvers, 5) Frontend route guards and component-level access control, 6) Audit logging for all permission changes and access attempts. Create default roles and permissions based on user personas defined in PRD. Implement role inheritance and permission aggregation logic.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for permission checking logic, integration tests for role assignment workflows, E2E tests for access control enforcement, security testing for privilege escalation attempts, audit log verification tests
