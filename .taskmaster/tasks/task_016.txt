# Task ID: 16
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Security Test Suite for Authentication Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an extensive security-focused test suite for all authentication components including CognitoService, AuthGuard, SMS verification Lambda, and auth effects with comprehensive coverage of security scenarios and edge cases.
# Details:
Build comprehensive security test suite with: 1) CognitoService unit tests covering authentication flows, token validation, session management, password policy enforcement, MFA scenarios, account lockout mechanisms, and security edge cases like token tampering and replay attacks, 2) AuthGuard unit tests for route protection, role-based access control validation, session expiration handling, concurrent session management, privilege escalation prevention, and unauthorized access attempts, 3) SMS verification Lambda function security tests including rate limiting validation, code generation randomness testing, timing attack prevention, SMS spoofing protection, and verification bypass attempt detection, 4) Auth effects integration tests covering error scenarios like network failures, service timeouts, malformed responses, concurrent authentication attempts, and state corruption recovery, 5) Security penetration testing for authentication bypass attempts, brute force attack protection, and session hijacking prevention, 6) Performance testing under load with concurrent authentication requests, 7) Mock implementations for external dependencies to ensure isolated testing. Implement test data factories for consistent test scenarios and security-focused test utilities for common attack patterns. Use tools like Jest for unit testing, Cypress for E2E security scenarios, and OWASP testing methodologies for security validation.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive test validation including: unit test coverage analysis ensuring >90% code coverage for all authentication components, security penetration testing using automated tools like OWASP ZAP and manual security testing for authentication bypass attempts, integration testing with mock AWS Cognito responses to validate error handling, load testing with concurrent authentication requests to verify rate limiting and performance, mutation testing to ensure test quality and edge case coverage, security regression testing for known vulnerability patterns, compliance testing against OWASP authentication security guidelines, and continuous security monitoring integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated security validation on every code change.
