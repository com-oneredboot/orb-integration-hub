# Task ID: 45
# Title: Fix Moderate NPM Security Vulnerabilities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 44
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve remaining moderate severity vulnerabilities in tough-cookie, request, ajv, and additional minimist/axios issues
# Details:
Update package-lock.json and frontend/package-lock.json for moderate vulnerabilities:
1. tough-cookie Prototype Pollution (#42) - Update to version >=4.0.0
2. Server-Side Request Forgery in Request (#41) - Replace with axios or node-fetch
3. Prototype Pollution in Ajv (#36) - Update to version >=6.12.3
4. Prototype Pollution in minimist (older CVE) (#33) - Ensure version >=1.2.6
5. Axios Cross-Site Request Forgery (#30) - Update to version >=0.21.2

Implementation steps:
- Update package.json dependencies to safe versions
- Replace deprecated 'request' package with modern alternatives
- Run 'npm install' to update lock files
- Run 'npm audit --audit-level moderate' to verify fixes

# Test Strategy:
Verify npm audit shows no moderate vulnerabilities in production dependencies. Test cookie handling functionality. Test JSON schema validation with ajv. Verify HTTP client functionality after request package replacement.
