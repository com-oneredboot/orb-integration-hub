# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Real-Time Features with WebSocket Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time capabilities using WebSocket connections and GraphQL subscriptions for live data updates, notifications, and event-driven workflows
# Details:
Implement real-time features with: 1) WebSocket connection management in Angular frontend, 2) GraphQL subscription setup for real-time data updates, 3) Event-driven notification system for user actions and system events, 4) Real-time dashboard updates for admin monitoring, 5) Connection resilience with automatic reconnection logic, 6) Message queuing for offline scenarios, 7) Rate limiting and connection management for scalability. Configure AppSync real-time subscriptions with proper authorization and filtering.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for WebSocket connection handling, integration tests for subscription data flow, E2E tests for real-time user interactions, load testing for concurrent WebSocket connections, network resilience testing for connection drops and recovery
