# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Input Validation and XSS Prevention for Authentication Forms
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust input validation and sanitization system specifically for authentication forms with comprehensive email, phone number, and verification code validation, plus XSS prevention and injection attack mitigation.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive input validation system with: 1) Email format validation using RFC 5322 compliant regex patterns with domain validation and disposable email detection, 2) Phone number validation implementing E.164 international standard with country code verification and formatting, 3) Verification code validation with format checking, expiration handling, and rate limiting, 4) Input sanitization library preventing XSS attacks using DOMPurify for frontend and bleach for backend, 5) SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries and input escaping, 6) CSRF token validation for all authentication forms, 7) Content Security Policy (CSP) headers implementation, 8) Input length validation and character whitelisting for all form fields. Create reusable validation components for Angular frontend and Python backend validators. Implement real-time client-side validation with server-side verification. Add comprehensive logging for validation failures and potential attack attempts. Configure rate limiting for form submissions to prevent brute force attacks.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all validation functions including edge cases and malicious input patterns, integration tests for form validation workflows, security penetration testing for XSS and injection vulnerabilities, automated security scanning with OWASP ZAP, validation bypass testing with malformed inputs, performance testing for validation overhead, E2E tests for complete authentication form validation flows, accessibility testing for validation error messages, cross-browser compatibility testing for validation behavior

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Input Validation Library with Email and Phone Number Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive validation library that handles email format validation using RFC 5322 compliant regex patterns with domain validation and disposable email detection, plus phone number validation implementing E.164 international standard with country code verification and formatting.
### Details:
Build reusable validation classes for both Angular frontend (TypeScript) and Python backend. Implement email validation with regex patterns, MX record checking, and disposable email provider blacklist. Create phone number validation using libphonenumber library for Python backend and a compatible TypeScript implementation for frontend. Include country code validation, number formatting, and carrier detection. Add input length validation and character whitelisting for all authentication form fields.

## 2. Implement Verification Code Validation System with Rate Limiting [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create a secure verification code validation system with format checking, expiration handling, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging for validation failures and potential attack attempts.
### Details:
Implement verification code generation with configurable length and character sets. Add expiration timestamp tracking and automatic cleanup of expired codes. Create rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute force attacks on verification codes with progressive delays and account lockout. Implement comprehensive logging system to track validation attempts, failures, and suspicious patterns. Add Redis-based storage for rate limiting counters and verification code tracking.

## 3. Implement XSS Prevention and Input Sanitization System [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create a robust input sanitization system preventing XSS attacks using DOMPurify for frontend and bleach for backend, with comprehensive content filtering and encoding.
### Details:
Integrate DOMPurify library in Angular frontend for client-side HTML sanitization. Implement bleach library in Python backend for server-side content sanitization. Create sanitization middleware that processes all authentication form inputs. Implement HTML entity encoding, JavaScript execution prevention, and dangerous tag/attribute removal. Add context-aware sanitization for different input types (email, phone, text fields). Create sanitization configuration profiles for different security levels.

## 4. Implement SQL Injection Prevention and CSRF Protection [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries and input escaping, plus CSRF token validation for all authentication forms.
### Details:
Replace all dynamic SQL queries with parameterized queries using SQLAlchemy ORM. Implement additional input escaping for edge cases. Create CSRF token generation and validation system with secure random token generation, token expiration, and per-session token management. Integrate CSRF middleware into all authentication endpoints. Add database query logging and monitoring for injection attempt detection. Implement prepared statement caching for performance optimization.

## 5. Implement Content Security Policy and Real-time Validation Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and integrate real-time client-side validation with server-side verification for a complete security implementation.
### Details:
Configure CSP headers with strict policies for script sources, style sources, and form actions. Implement nonce-based CSP for inline scripts and styles. Create real-time validation system in Angular that provides immediate feedback while maintaining server-side verification. Implement WebSocket or HTTP polling for real-time validation status updates. Add form submission rate limiting with progressive delays. Create comprehensive error handling and user feedback system. Implement validation result caching to improve performance.
