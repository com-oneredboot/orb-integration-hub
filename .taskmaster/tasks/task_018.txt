# Task ID: 18
# Title: CRITICAL: Security Vulnerabilities Remediation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Address 4 critical security vulnerabilities identified in pre-ship review that are production deployment blockers: sensitive information exposure in debug logging (CVSS 9.1), missing CSRF protection (CVSS 8.1), insufficient rate limiting (CVSS 7.8), and insecure error disclosure (CVSS 7.5).
# Details:
Implement immediate security fixes across four critical areas: **1) Sensitive Information Exposure in Debug Logging (CVSS 9.1):** Remove all sensitive data from debug logs including passwords, tokens, API keys, PII, and session identifiers. Implement log sanitization middleware that automatically redacts sensitive fields using regex patterns and field whitelisting. Configure production logging levels to exclude debug statements and implement structured logging with field-level sensitivity classification. Add log rotation and secure storage with encryption at rest. **2) Missing CSRF Protection (CVSS 8.1):** Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations in both GraphQL mutations and REST endpoints. Add CSRF middleware to validate tokens on server-side with proper token generation, validation, and expiration. Configure Angular HTTP interceptors to automatically include CSRF tokens in requests. Implement SameSite cookie attributes and proper CORS configuration. **3) Insufficient Rate Limiting (CVSS 7.8):** Implement comprehensive rate limiting using AWS API Gateway throttling and application-level rate limiting with Redis. Configure different rate limits for authentication endpoints (stricter), API endpoints (moderate), and public endpoints (basic). Implement progressive delays and account lockout mechanisms for repeated violations. Add rate limiting headers and proper error responses. **4) Insecure Error Disclosure (CVSS 7.5):** Replace detailed error messages with generic user-friendly messages while maintaining detailed logging for debugging. Implement error code mapping system that provides safe error responses to clients while logging full technical details server-side. Remove stack traces, file paths, database schema information, and internal system details from client responses. Configure proper HTTP status codes and implement error boundary components in frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive security validation including: 1) **Logging Security Testing:** Automated log analysis to verify no sensitive data appears in production logs, penetration testing for log injection attacks, verification of log sanitization effectiveness across all application layers, 2) **CSRF Protection Testing:** Automated CSRF attack simulation using security tools, manual testing of token validation across all endpoints, verification of proper token rotation and expiration, cross-browser testing for CSRF protection effectiveness, 3) **Rate Limiting Testing:** Load testing to verify rate limits are properly enforced, automated testing of progressive delay mechanisms, verification of rate limiting bypass prevention, testing of different rate limit tiers for various endpoint types, 4) **Error Disclosure Testing:** Automated scanning for information disclosure in error responses, manual testing of error handling across all failure scenarios, verification that technical details are not exposed to clients while maintaining proper logging, 5) **OWASP Compliance Verification:** Full OWASP Top 10 compliance testing using automated security scanners, manual penetration testing for all identified vulnerabilities, security code review focusing on the four critical areas, final security assessment to confirm all vulnerabilities are resolved and deployment blockers are cleared.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove Sensitive Information from Debug Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove all sensitive data exposure from debug logging in CognitoService (lines 77, 97, 123, etc.) that currently exposes usernames, passwords, and internal system details. Implement secure logging service with data sanitization.
### Details:
Critical vulnerability (CVSS 9.1) - Debug logging in cognito.service.ts exposes:
- User credentials (usernames, passwords)
- Internal system details
- User data and environment info

Files to fix:
- /frontend/src/app/core/services/cognito.service.ts (lines 77, 97, 123, 234, 314, 425, 503, 627)
- Implement secure logging service with data sanitization
- Replace console.debug/console.info with sanitized logging

Risk: Credential theft, system reconnaissance, compliance violations (GDPR, PCI-DSS)

## 2. Implement CSRF Protection for Authentication Forms [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Add CSRF token validation to all authentication forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. Implement Angular CSRF interceptor and server-side token validation.
### Details:
High vulnerability (CVSS 8.1) - Missing CSRF protection on authentication forms:
- All authentication forms lack CSRF tokens
- State-changing operations vulnerable to CSRF attacks
- No anti-CSRF measures implemented

Required implementation:
- Add Angular HttpClientXsrfModule to app.module.ts
- Configure CSRF token generation and validation
- Update all form submissions to include CSRF tokens
- Implement server-side token verification

Risk: Cross-site request forgery attacks, unauthorized actions, account takeover

## 3. Implement Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Add comprehensive rate limiting for authentication attempts with exponential backoff to prevent brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and account enumeration.
### Details:
High vulnerability (CVSS 7.8) - Insufficient rate limiting protection:
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts
- No brute force attack protection
- No progressive delays for failed attempts
- No account lockout mechanisms

Required implementation:
- Implement client-side rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Add failed attempt tracking per IP/user
- Configure progressive delay increases (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- Implement temporary account lockout after threshold
- Add monitoring and alerting for attack attempts

Risk: Credential stuffing attacks, account enumeration, resource exhaustion

## 4. Secure Error Handling and Information Disclosure Prevention [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Sanitize all error messages to prevent information disclosure, implement secure error handling patterns, and remove technical details from user-facing errors.
### Details:
High vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) - Insecure error information disclosure:
- Detailed error messages leak system internals
- Stack traces exposed to users
- Backend response details visible in errors
- System configuration information disclosed

Files to fix:
- /frontend/src/app/features/user/components/auth-flow/auth-flow.component.ts (lines 366-437)
- Error handling methods in all services
- Exception handling in auth effects

Required implementation:
- Sanitize all error messages before displaying to users
- Remove technical details (stack traces, config info)
- Implement secure error mapping service
- Add proper logging for debugging without user exposure
- Create user-friendly error messages

Risk: Information disclosure, system reconnaissance, attack vector identification
