# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement AWS Cognito Authentication Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up AWS Cognito user pools and identity pools with comprehensive authentication flows including registration, login, password reset, and multi-factor authentication
# Details:
Configure AWS Cognito User Pool with: 1) Custom user attributes for role-based access, 2) MFA configuration supporting SMS and TOTP, 3) Password policies meeting security requirements, 4) Custom authentication flows for branded experience, 5) Lambda triggers for user lifecycle events, 6) Identity Pool for federated access to AWS resources. Implement Cognito integration in both backend Python services and frontend Angular application using AWS Amplify Auth. Configure proper error handling for all authentication scenarios including account lockout, password complexity failures, and MFA setup issues.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with mock Cognito services, E2E tests for complete user registration and login journeys, security testing for authentication bypass attempts, load testing for concurrent authentication requests
