# Task ID: 49
# Title: Consolidate Deployment Artifacts into Single S3 Bucket with Organized Prefix Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Consolidate all deployment artifacts from multiple S3 buckets (orb-integration-hub-build-artifacts and orb-integration-hub-build-templates) into a single bucket with organized prefix structure using sam-builds/, layers/, and templates/ prefixes for better organization and management.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive S3 bucket consolidation and reorganization:

**1) S3 Bucket Analysis and Planning:**
- Audit existing artifacts in orb-integration-hub-build-artifacts and orb-integration-hub-build-templates buckets
- Catalog all artifact types, sizes, and access patterns to determine optimal prefix structure
- Create migration plan with rollback strategy and minimal downtime approach
- Design new bucket naming convention and lifecycle policies for consolidated storage

**2) New Bucket Structure Implementation:**
- Create new consolidated S3 bucket with appropriate IAM policies and versioning enabled
- Implement organized prefix structure:
  - `sam-builds/` - SAM application build artifacts, deployment packages, and CloudFormation templates
  - `layers/` - Lambda layer zip files, shared libraries, and runtime dependencies
  - `templates/` - CloudFormation templates, SAM templates, and infrastructure-as-code files
- Configure bucket policies for cross-account access if needed and proper encryption settings

**3) Artifact Migration Process:**
- Develop migration scripts using AWS CLI/SDK to copy artifacts with proper prefix assignment
- Implement parallel transfer optimization for large artifacts to minimize migration time
- Maintain original timestamps and metadata during migration process
- Create mapping documentation for old-to-new artifact locations

**4) CI/CD Pipeline Updates:**
- Update all build scripts, deployment pipelines, and GitHub Actions workflows to reference new bucket structure
- Modify SAM templates and CloudFormation references to use new artifact locations
- Update Lambda layer deployment scripts to use new layers/ prefix structure
- Ensure all automated deployment processes use consolidated bucket paths

**5) Access Control and Monitoring:**
- Implement least-privilege IAM policies for different artifact types and deployment stages
- Set up CloudWatch monitoring for bucket access patterns and cost optimization
- Configure S3 event notifications for artifact lifecycle management
- Implement automated cleanup policies for old build artifacts

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive validation of S3 bucket consolidation:

**1) Migration Verification:**
- Verify all artifacts successfully copied to new bucket with correct prefixes and metadata preservation
- Compare file counts, sizes, and checksums between source and destination buckets
- Test artifact accessibility from all deployment environments and CI/CD pipelines
- Validate that no artifacts were lost or corrupted during migration process

**2) Deployment Pipeline Testing:**
- Execute full deployment pipeline using artifacts from new consolidated bucket structure
- Test SAM builds using sam-builds/ prefix artifacts in development and staging environments
- Verify Lambda layer deployments work correctly with layers/ prefix structure
- Validate CloudFormation template deployments using templates/ prefix artifacts

**3) Access Control Validation:**
- Test IAM policies ensure proper access restrictions for different artifact types
- Verify cross-account access works correctly if applicable
- Test that unauthorized access attempts are properly denied
- Validate encryption and security settings are correctly applied

**4) Performance and Monitoring:**
- Monitor S3 access patterns and latency after migration to ensure no performance degradation
- Verify CloudWatch metrics and alarms are properly configured for new bucket
- Test automated cleanup policies work correctly without affecting active artifacts
- Validate cost optimization through consolidated storage and lifecycle policies

**5) Rollback Testing:**
- Test rollback procedures to ensure ability to revert to original bucket structure if needed
- Verify backup copies of critical artifacts are maintained during transition period
- Document and test emergency recovery procedures for artifact restoration
