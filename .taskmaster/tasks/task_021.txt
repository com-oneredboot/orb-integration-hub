# Task ID: 21
# Title: UX Enhancement: WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages Compliance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete the final 5% of accessibility compliance by enhancing status message announcements for loading states to achieve 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages compliance to complete accessibility requirements: 1) **Loading State Announcements:** Add proper ARIA live regions (aria-live="polite" or "assertive") for all loading states including form submissions, data fetching, and async operations with descriptive status messages like "Loading user data, please wait" or "Saving changes", 2) **Success/Error Message Enhancement:** Implement programmatic status announcements for form validation results, API responses, and user actions using aria-live regions and role="status" attributes, 3) **Screen Reader Optimization:** Add visually hidden status text that provides context for screen reader users during state changes, implement proper focus management after status changes, and ensure status messages are announced without interrupting user workflow, 4) **Loading Indicator Accessibility:** Replace visual-only loading spinners with accessible alternatives including aria-describedby attributes linking to status text, proper labeling of progress indicators, and timeout handling with user notifications, 5) **Dynamic Content Updates:** Implement proper announcements for dynamically updated content areas, real-time data changes, and background processes with appropriate politeness levels, 6) **Integration with Existing Components:** Update all PrimeNG components and custom Angular components to include proper status messaging, ensure compatibility with existing NgRx state management for status updates, and maintain consistency with established design patterns. This enhancement builds upon the existing 95% WCAG compliance achieved in Task 17 to reach full 100% compliance specifically targeting the remaining status message requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive WCAG 4.1.3 compliance validation: 1) **Automated Accessibility Testing:** Run axe-core and WAVE tools specifically targeting WCAG 4.1.3 criteria, validate all aria-live regions are properly implemented and functional, test status message announcements across all components, 2) **Screen Reader Testing:** Manual testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver to verify status messages are announced appropriately during loading states, form submissions, and dynamic content updates, test announcement timing and politeness levels, validate that status messages don't interrupt user workflow, 3) **Keyboard Navigation Testing:** Verify status messages are accessible via keyboard navigation, test focus management during status changes, ensure loading states don't trap keyboard focus, 4) **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test status message functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge with various assistive technologies, validate ARIA live region support consistency, 5) **User Journey Testing:** Complete E2E testing of authentication flows, form submissions, and data loading scenarios to verify status announcements work in real user workflows, test timeout scenarios and error state announcements, 6) **Compliance Audit:** Conduct final WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit using both automated tools and manual testing to verify 100% compliance achievement, document all status message implementations for compliance records, validate against WCAG 4.1.3 success criteria specifically.

## 1. Enhance Loading State Announcements for Screen Readers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add comprehensive aria-live regions and status announcements for all loading states to achieve 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
### Details:
Minor accessibility enhancement - WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages:
- Current compliance: 95% WCAG 2.1 AA
- Target: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Issue: Minor improvement needed for loading state announcements

Required implementation:
- Add comprehensive aria-live regions for loading states
- Implement status announcements for:
  * Step transition loading
  * Form validation in progress
  * Authentication processing
  * Background operations

Implementation:
```html
<div aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\" class=\"sr-only\">
  <span *ngIf=\"isStepTransitioning\">{{ loadingMessage }}</span>
  <span *ngIf=\"validationInProgress\">Validating your information...</span>
</div>
```

Impact: Achieves perfect accessibility compliance and improves screen reader experience
