# Task ID: 29
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Organizations Feature
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 25, 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document that consolidates expert feedback from DevSecOps, Principal Software Engineer, Senior UX/UI Engineer, and Principal QA Engineer to define technical architecture, security requirements, user experience flows, and detailed specifications for the organizations feature. This PRD has been completed with consolidated requirements from 42 expert questions and defines the complete business model, technical architecture, and implementation strategy.
# Details:
Comprehensive PRD completed addressing all critical aspects of the organizations feature: **1) Business Model & Terminology:** Defined clear distinction between USER (free authentication) and CUSTOMER (paid subscriber), with organizations created only when USER becomes CUSTOMER. **2) Starter Plan MVP Limits:** 1 organization per CUSTOMER, 1 application per organization, 5 environments per application, 100 users per application. **3) Organization Role Hierarchy:** OWNER (tied to USER_ID, full control), ADMINISTRATOR (user management, application updates), VIEWER (read-only access). **4) UI/UX Design Specifications:** Organizations integrated into Applications tab for CUSTOMERS only, two-table layout with click-to-edit organizations table and radio-button-driven applications table, merged cell design for environments, transfer functionality for OWNERS. **5) Technical Architecture:** Full end-goal architecture implementation from start with UI restrictions enforcing starter plan limits, feature flags for tier upgrades, custom ApplicationRoles table supporting customer-defined roles. **6) Notification System:** Comprehensive notification types for APPLICATION_TRANSFER_REQUEST/COMPLETED, ORGANIZATION_INVITATION_RECEIVED/ACCEPTED/REJECTED. **7) QA Strategy:** Dedicated persistent test organizations, combined testing approach with operation-based + role-specific + boundary testing, prioritized E2E workflows. **8) Success Metrics:** Adoption, business, and technical KPIs defined for measuring feature success.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive PRD validation completed through expert consolidation and requirement finalization: **1) Expert Feedback Integration:** Successfully consolidated feedback from all 42 expert questions into unified requirements covering business model, technical architecture, security, UX/UI, and QA strategies. **2) Business Model Validation:** Confirmed USER vs CUSTOMER distinction, starter plan limits, and organization creation triggers aligned with business objectives. **3) Technical Architecture Validation:** Verified full end-goal implementation approach with feature flag strategy for tier management and custom role system architecture. **4) UI/UX Design Validation:** Validated two-table layout design, click-to-edit functionality, radio button organization selection, and transfer workflow specifications. **5) QA Strategy Validation:** Confirmed dedicated test organization approach, combined testing methodology, and prioritized E2E workflow coverage for critical user journeys.
