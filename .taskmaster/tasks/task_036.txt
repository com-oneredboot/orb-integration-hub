# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Dynamic User Experience with Professional Onboarding and Interactive Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 27, 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive getting started experience with professional empty state illustrations, contextual onboarding tips, clear CTAs, progressive disclosure patterns, and smart defaults to enhance first-time user engagement and reduce cognitive load.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive dynamic user experience enhancements across multiple areas: **1) Getting Started Experience & Empty States:** Create professional empty state illustrations using consistent design system with branded iconography and messaging, implement contextual empty states for organizations list, applications dashboard, and user management sections with clear value propositions and next steps. Design welcome screens with progressive onboarding flows that introduce key concepts without overwhelming users. **2) Contextual Onboarding System:** Build intelligent onboarding tip system using Angular services to track user progress and display contextual hints based on user actions and current page context. Implement tooltip overlays, guided tours, and progressive disclosure patterns that reveal advanced features as users become more comfortable. Create onboarding checklist component showing completion progress with celebratory micro-interactions. **3) Clear Call-to-Action Framework:** Design and implement prominent, contextually-aware CTAs for creating first organization and application with proper visual hierarchy and accessibility. Create action-oriented button components with loading states, success feedback, and error handling. Implement smart CTA positioning based on user context and completion status. **4) Interactive Loading & Skeleton States:** Develop comprehensive loading state system using skeleton screens that match actual content layout, implement progressive loading patterns for data-heavy sections, create smooth transitions between loading and loaded states. Build reusable skeleton components for tables, cards, and forms with proper animation timing and accessibility considerations. **5) Progressive Disclosure & Smart Defaults:** Implement expandable detail sections using Angular animations to reduce visual clutter while maintaining information accessibility. Create smart default system that pre-populates common filters based on user behavior patterns and displays most relevant data first. Build collapsible panels, accordion components, and tabbed interfaces that maintain state across sessions. **6) User Experience Orchestration:** Integrate all components with existing SharedDataTableComponent and organization management flows, ensure consistent interaction patterns across all features, implement user preference persistence for disclosure states and default selections.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive user experience validation through multiple testing approaches: **1) Onboarding Flow Testing:** Conduct user testing sessions with first-time users to validate onboarding effectiveness and measure task completion rates, test contextual hint system by simulating various user paths and verifying appropriate tip display, validate onboarding checklist functionality and progress tracking accuracy. **2) Interactive Component Testing:** Unit test all skeleton loading components for proper animation timing and accessibility compliance, test progressive disclosure components for state management and smooth transitions, validate CTA components across different user contexts and completion states. **3) Empty State & Default Testing:** Test empty state illustrations and messaging across all major sections with various user scenarios, validate smart defaults system by testing filter pre-population with different user behavior patterns, test responsive behavior of all interactive components across desktop and mobile devices. **4) Integration & Performance Testing:** Test integration with existing SharedDataTableComponent and organization management flows, validate loading state performance and smooth transitions under various network conditions, conduct accessibility testing for all interactive elements including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. **5) User Experience Metrics:** Implement analytics tracking for onboarding completion rates, time-to-first-value metrics, and user engagement with interactive elements, conduct A/B testing for different CTA placements and messaging variations, measure user satisfaction through post-onboarding surveys and feedback collection.
