# Task ID: 42
# Title: Fix Critical NPM Security Vulnerabilities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Address the three critical severity vulnerabilities in npm packages: Prototype Pollution in minimist, Arbitrary Code Execution in underscore, and Path Traversal in decompress
# Details:
Update package-lock.json to fix critical vulnerabilities:
1. minimist (#40) - Update to version >=1.2.6 to fix prototype pollution
2. underscore (#35) - Update to version >=1.13.0-2 to fix arbitrary code execution
3. decompress (#34) - Update to version >=4.2.1 to fix path traversal

Implementation steps:
- Run 'npm audit' to identify current versions
- Update package.json dependencies to safe versions
- Run 'npm install' to update package-lock.json
- Verify fixes with 'npm audit --audit-level critical'
- Test application startup and core functionality

# Test Strategy:
Run npm audit to verify critical vulnerabilities are resolved. Execute smoke tests on core application features. Verify no new vulnerabilities introduced. Test application builds successfully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Current Vulnerabilities and Update Package Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify current vulnerable package versions and update package.json with secure versions for minimist, underscore, and decompress packages
### Details:
Run 'npm audit' to document current vulnerable versions. Update package.json dependencies: minimist to >=1.2.6, underscore to >=1.13.0-2, and decompress to >=4.2.1. Check for any direct dependencies in package.json that need updating, and also review devDependencies section for these packages.

## 2. Install Updated Packages and Regenerate Lock File [done]
### Dependencies: 42.1
### Description: Execute npm install to update package-lock.json with the new secure package versions and resolve dependency tree
### Details:
Run 'npm install' to update package-lock.json with the new secure versions. This will resolve the dependency tree and ensure all transitive dependencies are updated appropriately. If there are any peer dependency warnings or conflicts, resolve them by updating related packages or using npm install --legacy-peer-deps if necessary.

## 3. Validate Security Fixes and Application Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 42.2
### Description: Confirm all critical vulnerabilities are resolved and verify application functionality remains intact after package updates
### Details:
Run 'npm audit --audit-level critical' to verify zero critical vulnerabilities. Test application startup process and core functionality that may use the updated packages. Pay special attention to any code that processes user input (minimist), data manipulation (underscore), or file operations (decompress). Document the vulnerability resolution in commit message with specific CVE numbers if available.
