# Task ID: 26
# Title: Principal Software Engineer Architecture Review: Organizations Feature Technical Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive technical architecture review and implementation for the organizations feature addressing data model optimization with confirmed API key system, GraphQL schema design with proper enum definitions, state management, migration strategy, performance optimization, and error handling across all system layers. Optimized for small team usage (typically <10 users per organization, maximum 5 organizations per user) with greenfield development approach.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive organizations feature architecture with the following components: **1) Data Model Design Optimization:** Design optimized DynamoDB table structures with confirmed Applications table using dual API key system (apiKey/apiKeyNext fields) with validity periods for zero-downtime rotation, and Organizations table with userId as hash key and organizationId as range key reflecting ownership model. Implement structured API key format using app_env_{environment}_sk_{random} pattern. Design for small team usage patterns (typically <10 users per organization, maximum 5 organizations per user, typically 1 application with 1-5 environments per organization). **2) Global Secondary Index Strategy:** Implement required GSIs for 'all users in organization' and 'all applications in organization' lookups to support Applications tab with <2s load time and <500ms individual query performance. **3) Authentication & Authorization:** Implement Authorization: Bearer {apiKey} header authentication for GraphQL endpoints with proper API key validation and rotation handling. **4) Schema Definitions:** Create comprehensive enum definitions in schemas/core directory including OrganizationStatusEnum (with PENDING status for pre-payment organizations), OrganizationUserRoleEnum, ApplicationUserRoleEnum, ApplicationEnvironmentEnum, NotificationStatusEnum, and NotificationTypeEnum. **5) Relationship Management:** Implement cascading delete operations using DynamoDB transactions with proper referential integrity checks across User-Organization, Organization-Application, and Permission tables. Design atomic operations for multi-table updates with forward-only migration approach using feature flags rather than data rollbacks. **6) GraphQL Schema Evolution:** Extend AppSync schema with Organization, OrganizationMember, and OrganizationRole entities using confirmed enum definitions. Implement batch operations using DataLoader pattern for N+1 query prevention, add simple pagination for organization member lists, and create subscription resolvers for real-time ApplicationUsers role changes. **7) Migration Strategy:** Develop greenfield deployment strategy with feature flags for gradual rollout, incorporating API key rotation strategy. Implement organization creation on payment completion with PENDING status handling and auto-creation of default organizations for paying customers. **8) Performance Optimization:** Optimize for read-heavy workloads with aggressive caching and targeted cache invalidation. Implement initial data loading pattern (all orgs → all apps/environments → populate frontend stores) with strongly consistent reads only when necessary. Support nested queries while maintaining DynamoDB performance optimization. **9) Error Handling:** Create comprehensive error handling with forward-only approach using status tracking (TRANSFER_PENDING → retry logic → TRANSFER_FAILED). Implement retry logic for invitation/notification failures with eventual consistency handling.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive validation across all architectural components: **1) Data Model Testing:** Unit tests for all DynamoDB query patterns with confirmed table structures optimized for small team usage, API key rotation testing with zero-downtime validation, load testing for concurrent organization operations with <10 users per organization, GSI performance testing for Applications tab queries (<2s load time, <500ms individual queries). **2) Authentication Testing:** API key validation testing with Bearer token authentication, API key rotation testing with apiKey/apiKeyNext field transitions, structured API key format validation testing. **3) Schema Testing:** Enum definition validation across all core schemas including PENDING status handling, GraphQL schema validation tests for all new entities and relationships with proper enum usage, resolver performance testing with small team datasets. **4) State Management Testing:** NgRx store testing for organization context switching scenarios with initial data loading pattern, aggressive caching validation with targeted invalidation testing, memory leak testing for long-running organization sessions. **5) Migration Testing:** Greenfield deployment testing with feature flag validation, organization creation testing with payment completion flow and PENDING status handling, default organization auto-creation testing. **6) Performance Testing:** Load testing for organization queries under peak traffic with small team constraints, Applications tab performance testing (<2s load time), nested query performance validation while maintaining DynamoDB optimization. **7) Error Handling Testing:** Forward-only error handling testing with status tracking (TRANSFER_PENDING → TRANSFER_FAILED), retry mechanism testing for invitation/notification failures, eventual consistency testing with strongly consistent reads validation. **8) Integration Testing:** Cross-service testing for organization features with authentication and authorization systems using Bearer token authentication, real-time subscription testing for ApplicationUsers role changes, API contract testing for all organization endpoints with small team usage patterns.
