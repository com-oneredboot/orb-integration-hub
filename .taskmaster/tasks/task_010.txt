# Task ID: 10
# Title: Build Integration Engine with Protocol Adapters
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the integration engine supporting multiple protocols (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket) with data transformation capabilities and extensible plugin architecture
# Details:
Create integration engine with: 1) Protocol adapter framework supporting REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket integrations, 2) Data transformation engine with configurable mapping rules, 3) Plugin system architecture allowing custom integrations without code changes, 4) Integration configuration interface for non-technical users, 5) Data routing and filtering capabilities, 6) Integration monitoring and health checking, 7) Error handling and retry mechanisms for external service failures. Implement proper abstraction layers for easy extension and maintenance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all protocol adapters, integration tests with mock external services, E2E tests for complete integration workflows, plugin system testing with sample plugins, performance testing for data transformation throughput, reliability testing for external service failures
