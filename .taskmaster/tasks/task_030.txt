# Task ID: 30
# Title: Establish Organizations Feature Development Framework and Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5, 6, 29
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive development framework for the organizations feature including feature branch setup, approval workflows, technical design documentation, development phases, testing environments, rollback strategies, monitoring requirements, and frontend component structure.
# Details:
Establish comprehensive development framework across multiple critical areas: **1) Feature Branch Setup & Documentation Structure:** Create dedicated feature branch `feature/organizations` with proper branching strategy from main, establish documentation hierarchy under `docs/organizations/` including technical specifications, API documentation, user guides, and deployment procedures. Set up automated documentation generation from code comments and maintain version-controlled design documents. **2) Approval Workflow Implementation:** Implement multi-stage approval process requiring stakeholder sign-off before implementation phases, create approval gates for technical design review (Principal Software Engineer), security review (DevSecOps), UX/UI review (Senior UX/UI Engineer), and QA review (Principal QA Engineer). Establish automated workflow triggers in GitHub Actions with required reviewers and approval criteria. **3) Technical Design Documentation:** Create comprehensive technical design documents addressing expert concerns including security architecture diagrams, data flow specifications, API contract definitions, database schema evolution plans, integration patterns, and performance optimization strategies. Document scalability considerations, multi-tenancy implementation approach, and data isolation mechanisms. **4) Development Phases & Milestones:** Define structured development phases including Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure & Data Models), Phase 2 (API Development & Security Implementation), Phase 3 (Frontend Components & User Flows), Phase 4 (Integration & Testing), and Phase 5 (Deployment & Monitoring). Establish clear milestone criteria, deliverables, and success metrics for each phase with timeline estimates and resource allocation. **5) Feature-Specific Testing Environments:** Set up isolated testing environments including development sandbox with synthetic data, staging environment mirroring production configuration, security testing environment for penetration testing, performance testing environment for load testing, and user acceptance testing environment. Implement data isolation strategies ensuring test data doesn't interfere with production systems. **6) Rollback & Migration Strategies:** Develop comprehensive rollback procedures including database migration rollback scripts, feature flag configuration for gradual rollout, blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates, data backup and recovery procedures, and emergency rollback protocols. Create migration testing procedures and validation checkpoints. **7) Monitoring & Observability Requirements:** Establish monitoring framework including application performance monitoring (APM) for organizations feature, custom metrics for organization-specific operations, alerting rules for critical failures, logging standards for audit trails, and dashboard creation for real-time monitoring. Implement distributed tracing for multi-service operations and error tracking for user-facing issues. **8) Frontend Component Structure:** Create systematic frontend architecture under `frontend/src/app/features/organizations/` following established patterns from authentication flow, including component hierarchy (containers, presentational components, shared components), service layer for API integration, state management with NgRx feature modules, routing configuration with lazy loading, and shared utilities. Implement consistent naming conventions, folder structure, and code organization patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive framework validation through multiple verification approaches: **1) Development Framework Testing:** Validate feature branch setup by creating test commits and verifying proper branching strategy, test approval workflow by simulating approval requests and verifying all stakeholder notifications and approval gates function correctly, validate documentation structure by generating sample documentation and verifying automated generation processes. **2) Technical Design Validation:** Conduct design review sessions with each expert stakeholder to validate technical design documents address their specific concerns, perform architecture review to ensure scalability and security requirements are properly documented, validate API contract definitions through contract testing and mock implementations. **3) Development Phase Testing:** Test milestone criteria by creating sample deliverables for each phase and validating against success metrics, verify timeline estimates through capacity planning and resource allocation validation, test phase transition procedures to ensure smooth progression between development stages. **4) Testing Environment Validation:** Verify environment isolation by deploying test applications and confirming data separation, test environment provisioning and teardown procedures, validate synthetic data generation and management processes, perform cross-environment testing to ensure consistency across all testing stages. **5) Rollback Strategy Testing:** Execute rollback procedures in staging environment to validate effectiveness, test database migration rollback scripts with sample schema changes, validate feature flag functionality for gradual rollout control, perform disaster recovery testing to ensure emergency rollback procedures work correctly. **6) Monitoring System Testing:** Deploy monitoring infrastructure and validate metric collection, test alerting rules with simulated failure scenarios, verify dashboard functionality and real-time data display, validate logging standards through sample log generation and analysis, test distributed tracing with multi-service operations. **7) Frontend Structure Testing:** Validate component structure by implementing sample components following established patterns, test lazy loading and routing configuration, verify NgRx integration and state management patterns, validate code organization and naming conventions through automated linting and structure validation tools.

### Details:
Create feature branch from main branch following GitFlow conventions. Establish documentation structure: `docs/organizations/technical-specs/`, `docs/organizations/api/`, `docs/organizations/user-guides/`, `docs/organizations/deployment/`. Set up automated documentation generation using tools like JSDoc or similar. Create README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. Initialize version-controlled design documents with proper naming conventions and templates.

## 2. Implement Multi-Stage Approval Workflow System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish comprehensive approval workflow with stakeholder sign-off requirements, automated GitHub Actions triggers, and approval gates for technical design, security, UX/UI, and QA reviews.
### Details:
Configure GitHub branch protection rules requiring reviews from designated teams. Set up GitHub Actions workflows with approval gates: technical design review (Principal Software Engineer), security review (DevSecOps), UX/UI review (Senior UX/UI Engineer), QA review (Principal QA Engineer). Create approval templates and checklists for each review type. Implement automated workflow triggers based on file changes and PR labels. Configure CODEOWNERS file for automatic reviewer assignment.

## 3. Create Comprehensive Technical Design Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop detailed technical design documents addressing security architecture, data flow specifications, API contracts, database schema evolution, integration patterns, and performance optimization strategies.
### Details:
