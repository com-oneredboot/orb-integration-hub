# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive UX/UI validation including: **1) Usability Testing:** Conduct user testing sessions with target personas (organization admins, multi-org users, new customers) to validate organization management flows and context switching patterns, perform task-based testing for invitation workflows measuring completion rates and error recovery, test role management interface with users of varying technical expertise to ensure intuitive permission assignment, and validate mobile responsiveness through device testing across iOS/Android platforms with different screen sizes. **2) Accessibility Testing:** Automated accessibility scanning using axe-core and WAVE tools to verify WCAG AA compliance, manual keyboard navigation testing for all interactive elements ensuring proper tab order and focus indicators, screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver to validate role management and hierarchy navigation, color contrast validation for all visual permission indicators and status elements, and assistive technology testing for complex interactions like drag-and-drop role assignment. **3) Visual Design Validation:** Cross-browser testing for design consistency across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, responsive design testing using browser dev tools and physical devices to validate mobile adaptations, theme testing for both light and dark modes ensuring proper contrast and readability, component integration testing to verify PrimeNG customizations don't break with library updates, and design system compliance validation ensuring consistency with existing authentication interfaces. **4) Interaction Design Testing:** User flow testing for complete organization onboarding journey measuring drop-off points and completion rates, context switching testing with users belonging to multiple organizations to validate mental model alignment, notification interaction testing to verify dismissal vs action patterns work intuitively, error state testing by triggering various failure scenarios and measuring user recovery success, and performance testing for complex interfaces ensuring smooth animations and responsive interactions. **5) Integration Testing:** Design handoff validation ensuring development implementation matches design specifications, component library testing to verify all custom components integrate properly with existing codebase, API integration testing to ensure UI states properly reflect backend data and loading states, and end-to-end user journey testing covering complete workflows from organization creation through role management and daily usage patterns.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Organization Management Flow and User Discovery Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive UX/UI designs for organization management including user onboarding, organization creation wizard, and discovery interface with search and filtering capabilities.
### Details:
Design progressive disclosure patterns for complex organization setup, create intuitive onboarding flows for new customers discovering organizations, implement user-friendly organization creation wizard with validation feedback, and develop organization discovery interface with search/filtering. Use PrimeNG components and ensure responsive design with light/dark theme support.

## 2. Design Organization Context Switching Interface [cancelled]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Create seamless context switching interface for multi-organization users with clear visual indicators, organization selector dropdown, and persistent context awareness.
### Details:
Design organization selector dropdown with recent/favorite organizations, create breadcrumb navigation showing current organization context, implement persistent organization indicator in header/navigation, and ensure clear visual indicators of current context. Include responsive breakpoints and mobile-optimized switching patterns.

Current implementation status: Organizations page exists at /customers/organizations with list/detail view functionality, but lacks context switching capability. Users can view organizations but cannot switch organizational context. The page contains a placeholder onEnterOrganization() method ready for implementation.

Key implementation requirements: 1) Complete the onEnterOrganization() method to enable users to "enter" an organization and establish working context, 2) Integrate organization selector component into header/navigation for easy context switching, 3) Implement organization context state management system to maintain selected organization across application sessions, 4) Develop context-aware routing patterns that respect and maintain organizational context throughout navigation.

Priority focus on enabling the core context switching functionality that allows users to seamlessly transition between different organizational contexts while maintaining their workflow state.

Based on the analysis, the current implementation uses a master-detail selection pattern rather than true context switching. The existing onEnterOrganization() placeholder method needs to be implemented to establish organizational context state management. Current gaps include: no organization context persistence across routes, applications component lacks organization filtering, missing organization-aware routing patterns like /org/:id/applications, and no header-based organization selector for quick context switching. The radio button selection currently only displays organization details in tabs but doesn't establish working context. Implementation should focus on converting the placeholder onEnterOrganization() method into a full context establishment system that persists organization state, updates routing context, and enables organization-filtered views across all application components.
