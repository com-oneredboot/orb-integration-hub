# Task ID: 20
# Title: CRITICAL: Testing Infrastructure and Quality Assurance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 6, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Address 4 critical testing gaps identified in pre-ship review that are production deployment blockers: test compilation failures, missing E2E test suite, insufficient performance validation, and incomplete integration testing to achieve >85% test coverage.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure remediation across four critical areas: **1) Test Compilation Failures Resolution:** Fix all TypeScript compilation errors in test files by updating type definitions, resolving import path issues, and ensuring compatibility between test frameworks and application code. Update Jest configuration for proper module resolution, fix Angular testing module configurations, and resolve dependency injection issues in component tests. Implement automated pre-commit hooks to prevent compilation failures from being committed. **2) End-to-End Test Suite Implementation:** Deploy complete E2E testing framework using Cypress or Playwright with comprehensive test scenarios covering: user authentication flows, admin interface operations, real-time features validation, cross-browser compatibility testing, mobile responsiveness verification, and critical user journeys. Configure E2E tests to run against staging environment with proper test data management and cleanup procedures. **3) Performance Validation Under Load:** Implement comprehensive performance testing suite using tools like Artillery, k6, or JMeter to validate: API response times under concurrent load (target <200ms for 95th percentile), database query performance with realistic data volumes, WebSocket connection scalability (target 1000+ concurrent connections), memory usage and garbage collection optimization, and CDN performance for static assets. Establish performance baselines and regression testing in CI/CD pipeline. **4) Integration Testing Enhancement:** Build comprehensive integration test suite covering: GraphQL API integration with DynamoDB, AWS Cognito authentication flows, real-time subscription functionality, third-party service integrations, error handling across service boundaries, and data consistency validation. Implement contract testing between frontend and backend services, mock external dependencies properly, and ensure integration tests run in isolated environments with proper test data seeding and cleanup.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive testing validation including: 1) **Test Infrastructure Validation:** Verify all test suites compile and execute successfully across development, staging, and CI environments, validate test coverage reporting accuracy and ensure >85% code coverage target is met, confirm automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline with proper failure notifications, 2) **E2E Test Suite Verification:** Execute complete E2E test suite across multiple browsers and devices, validate test stability with multiple consecutive runs, verify test data management and cleanup procedures work correctly, confirm E2E tests catch real user workflow issues, 3) **Performance Testing Validation:** Execute load testing scenarios with realistic user patterns and data volumes, validate performance metrics meet established SLA requirements, confirm performance regression detection in CI pipeline, verify system stability under sustained load conditions, 4) **Integration Testing Verification:** Execute all integration tests in isolated environments, validate proper mocking of external dependencies, confirm integration test coverage of all service boundaries, verify integration tests catch real service communication issues, 5) **Overall Quality Assurance:** Conduct comprehensive test coverage analysis to ensure >85% target is achieved, validate test execution time optimization for efficient CI/CD pipeline, confirm test result reporting and failure analysis capabilities, execute full regression testing suite to ensure no functionality degradation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Test Compilation Errors and Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve TypeScript compilation errors in test files, fix missing model imports, and restore automated test execution capability.
### Details:
Critical testing issue - Test compilation failures:
- TypeScript import resolution errors preventing test execution
- Missing model imports for UserStatus.enum, UserGroup.enum
- Build configuration preventing test execution
- Coverage tool (Karma/Istanbul) configuration issues

Files to fix:
- auth-flow.component.spec.ts
- cognito.service.spec.ts
- auth.guard.spec.ts
- Related test utility files

Required fixes:
- Update import paths: import { UserStatus } from '../../../core/models/UserStatusEnum'
- Fix all missing model and enum imports
- Update test configuration files (jest.config.js, karma.conf.js)
- Restore automated test execution capability

Impact: Enables automated test execution and quality validation

## 2. Implement Comprehensive E2E Testing Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Set up Cypress or Playwright framework and create comprehensive end-to-end tests for all authentication user journeys.
### Details:
Critical testing gap - Missing E2E test suite:
- No Cypress, Playwright, or Protractor framework detected
- No end-to-end test scenarios implemented
- Complete authentication flow validation missing
- Cross-browser journey testing absent

Required implementation:
- Install and configure Cypress framework
- Create E2E test structure and configuration
- Implement test scenarios:
  * Complete user registration journey
  * Existing user login flow
  * MFA setup and verification
  * Error recovery scenarios
  * Cross-browser compatibility tests

Test coverage targets:
- 100% critical user journeys
- All authentication steps validated
- Error scenarios and recovery paths
- Performance validation under load

Impact: Validates complete user experience and system functionality

## 3. Implement Performance Testing and Load Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive performance testing suite with load testing for 100+ concurrent users and memory leak validation under sustained operation.
### Details:
Critical testing gap - Insufficient performance validation:
- No load testing with concurrent users (target: 100+ concurrent)
- Memory leak validation under sustained operation missing
- Mobile device performance testing absent
- Network throttling scenarios not tested

Required implementation:
- Install and configure Artillery or JMeter for load testing
- Create performance test scenarios:
  * Load testing with 100+ concurrent users
  * Memory profiling with Chrome DevTools
  * Mobile device testing on actual hardware
  * Network throttling and slow connection tests
  * Stress testing with authentication rate limits

Performance targets:
- Page Load: <2s
- Step Transitions: <500ms
- Memory Usage: <100MB sustained
- 100+ concurrent users: <3s response time

Impact: Validates system performance under realistic production load

## 4. Complete Integration Testing and Backend Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive integration tests for backend API connections, error scenarios with actual services, and production environment validation.
### Details:
Critical testing gap - Incomplete integration testing:
- Backend API integration not validated
- Error scenario testing with actual services missing
- Production environment configuration testing absent
- Third-party service integration (Cognito, SMS) not tested
