# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Pre-Production Monitoring, Security, and Documentation Systems
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 12, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive pre-production systems including APM/RUM monitoring, real-time security event monitoring, performance baseline establishment, and final user documentation review to ensure production readiness for the authentication flow.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive pre-production readiness systems across four critical areas: **1) Production Monitoring Setup with APM and RUM Tools:** Configure Application Performance Monitoring using AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing, CloudWatch for metrics and logs aggregation, and implement Real User Monitoring with tools like DataDog RUM or New Relic Browser to track user experience metrics including page load times, Core Web Vitals, error rates, and user journey analytics. Set up custom dashboards for authentication flow performance, API response times, database query performance, and user conversion funnels. **2) Real-Time Security Event Monitoring Configuration:** Implement AWS GuardDuty for threat detection, AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings, and configure CloudTrail for API audit logging. Set up real-time alerting for suspicious authentication attempts, failed login patterns, privilege escalation attempts, and unusual API access patterns. Configure SIEM integration with tools like Splunk or ELK stack for advanced security analytics and incident response workflows. **3) Production Performance Baseline Establishment:** Conduct comprehensive performance testing using tools like Artillery.io or JMeter to establish baseline metrics for authentication API endpoints, database query performance, and frontend load times. Document acceptable performance thresholds including 95th percentile response times under normal load (target: <200ms for auth APIs), concurrent user capacity (target: 1000+ simultaneous authentications), and error rate thresholds (<0.1% for critical auth flows). Create automated performance regression testing pipeline. **4) Final User-Facing Documentation Review:** Conduct comprehensive review and finalization of all user-facing documentation including API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI specs, user guides for authentication flows, troubleshooting guides, security best practices documentation, and developer integration guides. Ensure documentation accuracy through technical review, user testing with sample integration scenarios, and accessibility compliance for documentation portal.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive pre-production validation including: 1) Monitoring system validation by generating synthetic load and verifying all metrics are captured correctly in APM dashboards, testing alert thresholds with simulated performance degradation, and validating RUM data collection across different browsers and devices, 2) Security monitoring validation through controlled security testing including simulated brute force attacks, privilege escalation attempts, and API abuse patterns to verify alert generation and incident response workflows, 3) Performance baseline validation by executing load tests at various scales (100, 500, 1000+ concurrent users) and documenting all performance metrics, conducting stress testing to identify breaking points, and validating performance regression detection in CI/CD pipeline, 4) Documentation validation through technical accuracy review by development team, user acceptance testing with external developers following integration guides, accessibility testing of documentation portal, and validation of all code examples and API endpoints referenced in documentation.
