# Task ID: 43
# Title: Fix High Severity NPM Vulnerabilities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 42
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve high severity vulnerabilities in tar packages and axios SSRF/credential leakage issues across package-lock.json and frontend/package-lock.json
# Details:
Update both package-lock.json and frontend/package-lock.json:
1. tar package vulnerabilities (#44, #43, #39, #38, #37, #32) - Update to version >=6.1.2
2. axios SSRF and Credential Leakage (#31) - Update to version >=0.21.2

Implementation steps:
- Navigate to root directory and run 'npm update tar axios'
- Navigate to frontend/ directory and run 'npm update axios'
- Regenerate lock files with 'npm install'
- Run 'npm audit --audit-level high' in both directories
- Test HTTP requests and file operations functionality

# Test Strategy:
Verify npm audit shows no high severity vulnerabilities. Test API calls using axios work correctly. Test file upload/download features that use tar. Run integration tests for frontend-backend communication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update tar package vulnerabilities in root directory [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve high severity tar package vulnerabilities (#44, #43, #39, #38, #37, #32) by updating to version >=6.1.2 in the root package-lock.json
### Details:
Navigate to the root directory and run 'npm update tar' to update the tar package to version >=6.1.2. Then run 'npm install' to regenerate the package-lock.json file. Verify the updated version in package-lock.json and ensure all tar-related vulnerabilities are resolved.

## 2. Update axios SSRF vulnerabilities in root directory [done]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Resolve axios SSRF and credential leakage vulnerability (#31) by updating to version >=0.21.2 in the root package-lock.json
### Details:
In the root directory, run 'npm update axios' to update axios to version >=0.21.2. Run 'npm install' to regenerate the package-lock.json file. Verify the updated axios version addresses the SSRF and credential leakage issues.

## 3. Update axios vulnerabilities in frontend directory [done]
### Dependencies: 43.2
### Description: Resolve axios SSRF and credential leakage vulnerability in the frontend package by updating to version >=0.21.2 in frontend/package-lock.json
### Details:
Navigate to the frontend/ directory and run 'npm update axios' to update axios to version >=0.21.2. Run 'npm install' to regenerate the frontend/package-lock.json file. Ensure the frontend axios package is properly updated and isolated from root dependencies.

## 4. Validate vulnerability resolution and functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 43.1, 43.2, 43.3
### Description: Perform comprehensive validation to ensure all high severity vulnerabilities are resolved and application functionality remains intact
### Details:
Run 'npm audit --audit-level high' in both root and frontend directories to confirm no high severity vulnerabilities remain. Verify tar package version >=6.1.2 and axios version >=0.21.2 in both package-lock.json files. Test critical application functionality including file operations, HTTP requests, and API integrations.
