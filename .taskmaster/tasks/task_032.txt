# Task ID: 32
# Title: Design System Alignment Phase 1 - Organizations and Applications Pages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 27, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Transform Organizations and Applications pages to match Dashboard/Profile design system with consistent colors, typography, visual hierarchy, and interactive elements using professional gradients and FontAwesome iconography.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive design system alignment across Organizations and Applications pages: **1) Color System Implementation:** Apply consistent color variables throughout components using v.$orb-red (#FF4444) for primary actions and alerts, v.$orb-white (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds and text, and v.$orb-dark-blue (#1A365D) for headers and navigation elements. Update all existing color references in SCSS files and component styles. **2) Typography Standardization:** Implement Dashboard-matching typography patterns with 2.5rem (40px) for main page titles using font-weight: 600, 1.125rem (18px) for section subtitles with font-weight: 500, and maintain consistent line-height ratios of 1.2 for titles and 1.4 for body text. **3) Visual Hierarchy Enhancement:** Restructure page layouts with proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) matching Dashboard patterns, implement consistent spacing using 1.5rem gap patterns between sections, and establish clear content grouping with proper visual separation. **4) Header Styling with Professional Gradients:** Create gradient backgrounds for page headers using linear-gradient combinations of orb-dark-blue to lighter variants, implement subtle shadow effects (box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)), and ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility. **5) Status Indicators and Interactive Elements:** Design consistent status badges using orb color palette with proper hover states, implement interactive buttons with smooth transitions (transition: all 0.3s ease), and create loading states matching Dashboard patterns. **6) FontAwesome Icon Integration:** Replace existing icons with professional FontAwesome alternatives, maintain consistent icon sizing (1rem for inline, 1.5rem for standalone), and implement proper icon-text alignment with margin spacing. **7) Content Spacing and Layout:** Apply 1.5rem gap patterns using CSS Grid and Flexbox, implement responsive breakpoints matching Dashboard behavior, and ensure consistent padding/margin ratios across all components.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive design system validation through multiple verification approaches: **1) Visual Consistency Testing:** Perform side-by-side comparison of Organizations/Applications pages with Dashboard/Profile pages to verify color consistency, typography matching, and visual hierarchy alignment. Use browser developer tools to inspect computed styles and confirm proper CSS variable usage. **2) Responsive Design Validation:** Test all pages across multiple breakpoints (mobile: 320px-768px, tablet: 768px-1024px, desktop: 1024px+) to ensure consistent spacing and layout behavior matching Dashboard patterns. **3) Accessibility Compliance Testing:** Validate color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text), test keyboard navigation flow, and verify screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements. **4) Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test design consistency across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers, verify gradient rendering and FontAwesome icon display, and validate CSS Grid/Flexbox behavior. **5) Interactive Element Testing:** Verify hover states, focus indicators, and transition animations work consistently across all interactive components, test loading states and status indicators, and validate button behaviors match Dashboard patterns. **6) Typography Rendering:** Confirm font loading and rendering consistency, test text scaling at different zoom levels, and verify line-height and spacing calculations across different content lengths.
