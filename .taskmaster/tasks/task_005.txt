# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Centralized Error Handling and Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling system with standardized error codes, structured logging, and centralized error registry for consistent error management across the platform
# Details:
Build error handling system with: 1) Centralized error registry with standardized error codes and messages, 2) Structured error response format for GraphQL API, 3) Error classification system (validation, authorization, system, external), 4) Context-aware logging with correlation IDs for request tracing, 5) Error aggregation and monitoring dashboards, 6) Frontend error boundary components with user-friendly error displays. Implement error recovery strategies and retry mechanisms for transient failures. Configure CloudWatch alarms for critical error patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for error classification and formatting, integration tests for error propagation through system layers, E2E tests for user-facing error scenarios, monitoring tests for error aggregation and alerting, load testing for error handling under stress
