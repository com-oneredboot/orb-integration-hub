# Task ID: 24
# Title: Establish Quarterly Maintenance and Compliance Program
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 5, 11, 15, 16, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive quarterly maintenance program including security audits, penetration testing, performance optimization reviews, dependency updates, and regulatory compliance audits for ongoing system health and security.
# Details:
Establish a systematic quarterly maintenance program with: 1) **Security Audit Framework:** Automated security scanning using OWASP ZAP, Nessus, and custom security test suites, quarterly penetration testing by certified ethical hackers focusing on authentication flows, API endpoints, and data access controls, vulnerability assessment reports with CVSS scoring and remediation timelines, security posture reviews including access control audits and privilege escalation testing, 2) **Performance Optimization Reviews:** Quarterly performance benchmarking of GraphQL API response times, database query optimization analysis, frontend bundle size and load time assessments, infrastructure scaling recommendations based on usage patterns, CDN and caching strategy reviews, memory and CPU utilization analysis with optimization recommendations, 3) **Dependency Management Program:** Automated dependency vulnerability scanning using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency Check, quarterly major version updates for critical dependencies (Angular, AWS SDK, PrimeNG), security patch deployment within 48 hours of release for critical vulnerabilities, dependency license compliance reviews, deprecation timeline tracking for end-of-life dependencies, 4) **Regulatory Compliance Maintenance:** Quarterly GDPR compliance audits including data processing reviews and consent management validation, HIPAA compliance assessments for healthcare tenants, SOC 2 Type II audit preparation and evidence collection, data retention policy enforcement reviews, privacy impact assessments for new features, compliance documentation updates and staff training programs. Implement automated monitoring dashboards, compliance reporting templates, and escalation procedures for critical findings.

# Test Strategy:
Validate maintenance program effectiveness through: 1) **Security Testing Validation:** Execute quarterly penetration tests against authentication flows and verify all critical vulnerabilities are remediated within SLA, validate security scanning automation produces accurate vulnerability reports with zero false negatives for known issues, test incident response procedures with simulated security events, 2) **Performance Testing:** Benchmark API response times before and after optimization showing measurable improvements, validate performance monitoring alerts trigger correctly under load conditions, test scalability improvements handle 2x traffic without degradation, 3) **Dependency Testing:** Verify automated dependency scanning detects known vulnerabilities within 24 hours, test dependency update procedures don't break existing functionality through comprehensive regression testing, validate license compliance scanning identifies all GPL and copyleft licenses, 4) **Compliance Testing:** Audit compliance reporting accuracy against actual system configurations, test data retention policies automatically delete data per schedule, validate consent management workflows meet GDPR requirements through end-to-end testing, verify compliance dashboard metrics match manual audit findings with 100% accuracy.
