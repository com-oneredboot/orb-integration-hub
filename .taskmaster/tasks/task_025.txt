# Details:
Implement comprehensive multi-tenant security architecture across multiple phases: **Phase 1 - DynamoDB Multi-Tenancy Foundation:** 1) Design organization-partitioned DynamoDB table structure with composite partition keys (orgId#entityType#entityId) ensuring complete data isolation between organizations, 2) Implement defense-in-depth security using both middleware validation and DynamoDB condition expressions to prevent cross-organization data access, 3) Create Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) optimized for organization-scoped queries with proper key distribution to prevent hot partitions, 4) Implement DynamoDB auto-scaling policies and partition key design patterns to handle varying organization sizes and activity levels. **Phase 2 - Organization-Specific Encryption:** 1) Implement separate KMS keys per organization for enhanced security and limited blast radius, 2) Create organization-specific encryption for auth/authorization data including user credentials, tokens, and sensitive organization information, 3) Build key management system with automated key rotation and organization lifecycle management, 4) Implement encrypted data storage and retrieval patterns with organization-scoped key access. **Phase 3 - Access Control & Role Hierarchy:** 1) Implement hierarchical role-based access control system with owner > administrator > member permissions enforced at GraphQL resolver level, 2) Create organization context middleware ensuring all API operations are scoped to user's authorized organizations, 3) Implement hybrid payment validation for owner succession with payment verification before ownership transfer completion, 4) Build internal invitation system using in-app notifications with 24-hour expiration and single-use JWT tokens. **Phase 4 - Production Security & DevSecOps:** 1) Implement separate approval workflow for production environment access requiring explicit organization owner approval, 2) Create time-limited production access with 24-hour renewable sessions and automatic reversion to organization-level permissions, 3) Build enhanced audit logging for all production operations with full event tracking and real-time alerts, 4) Implement staging/dev environment access using standard organization role permissions only. **Phase 5 - Comprehensive Audit & Compliance:** 1) Implement comprehensive audit logging system capturing all CRUD operations, role changes, application transfers, financial events, API key rotations, and security violations with 7-year immutable retention, 2) Build GDPR/CCPA compliance framework with 30-day complete data deletion workflows, data residency controls (US customers in US regions), and machine-readable data export in JSON format, 3) Implement right to portability support and GDPR Article 17 'right to be forgotten' with verification, 4) Create privacy by design framework with minimal data collection and regular compliance audits. **Phase 6 - Performance & Monitoring:** 1) Implement DynamoDB query optimization with proper use of partition keys and GSIs to minimize scan operations, 2) Create monitoring dashboards for multi-tenant performance metrics, hot partition detection, security events, and production access activities, 3) Build automated testing framework for multi-tenant scenarios including data isolation verification and performance testing under various organization sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive multi-tenant security testing including: 1) Defense-in-depth testing validating both middleware and DynamoDB condition expression security layers, data isolation testing with automated scripts creating multiple organizations and verifying complete data separation using different user contexts, cross-organization access attempt testing, and partition key validation, 2) Organization-specific encryption testing verifying separate KMS key functionality, encrypted data storage/retrieval, key rotation processes, and blast radius limitation validation, 3) Role hierarchy testing verifying owner > administrator > member permission enforcement across all API operations, hybrid payment validation workflow testing for ownership transfers, and privilege escalation prevention, 4) Production environment security testing including owner approval workflow validation, 24-hour session time limits with renewal testing, enhanced audit logging verification, and automatic permission reversion validation, 5) Comprehensive audit logging testing including all CRUD operations tracking, role change state verification, application transfer audit chains, financial event logging, API key rotation tracking, and 7-year retention compliance validation, 6) GDPR/CCPA compliance testing including 30-day complete data deletion verification (excluding audit logs), data residency enforcement testing, JSON data export validation, right to portability workflow testing, and 'right to be forgotten' implementation verification, 7) Internal invitation system testing including in-app notification delivery, 24-hour token expiration validation, single-use JWT token verification, and invitation acceptance workflows, 8) Security penetration testing including organization boundary bypass attempts, invitation token manipulation, audit log tampering prevention, production access escalation attempts, and unauthorized data access scenarios, 9) Performance testing with varying organization sizes to validate DynamoDB scaling, hot partition prevention, and GSI query efficiency under load, 10) Automated security scanning for multi-tenant vulnerabilities and continuous monitoring validation for anomaly detection accuracy including production access monitoring and real-time alerting.

### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create organization-partitioned DynamoDB table schema with composite partition keys ensuring complete data isolation between organizations
### Details:
Design table structure using composite partition keys (orgId#entityType#entityId) pattern. Create separate tables for organizations, users, applications, and audit logs. Implement partition key design to prevent hot partitions by distributing organization data evenly. Define sort key patterns for efficient querying within organization boundaries.
<info added on 2025-06-23T00:54:36.720Z>
Completed DynamoDB multi-tenant table structure design with organization partitioning. Successfully created Organizations, OrganizationUsers, and Notifications schemas. Updated Applications schema to include organizationId for proper multi-tenant isolation. Implemented dual API key system (apiKey/apiKeyNext) for rotation. Added all required enums including OrganizationStatus, OrganizationUserRole (ADMINISTRATOR, VIEWER only - OWNER determined by Organizations.ownerId field), OrganizationUserStatus, NotificationType, and NotificationStatus. Fixed critical security distinction between Cognito Groups (OWNER=platform owner, EMPLOYEE=staff, CUSTOMER=paying users, USER=free users) and Organization ownership (determined by ownerId field). Updated authConfig for all organization tables to include OWNER, EMPLOYEE, CUSTOMER groups for proper platform administration access. Schema generation tested and completed successfully - all TypeScript and Python models generated correctly.
