# Task ID: 46
# Title: Security Audit and Regression Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive security audits and regression testing to ensure all vulnerabilities are resolved without breaking functionality
# Details:
Comprehensive validation and testing:
1. Run final security audits: 'npm audit' and 'pipenv check' in all directories
2. Execute full test suite to ensure no regressions
3. Perform manual testing of critical user journeys
4. Document any breaking changes or required code modifications
5. Update CI/CD pipeline security checks if needed

Implementation steps:
- Run 'npm audit --production' in root and frontend directories
- Run 'pipenv check' in all Python directories
- Execute automated test suites
- Perform smoke tests on key application features
- Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Commit updated lock files to repository

# Test Strategy:
All security audits pass with zero critical/high vulnerabilities. Full test suite passes without failures. Manual testing confirms no functional regressions. Security scanning tools show improved security posture.
