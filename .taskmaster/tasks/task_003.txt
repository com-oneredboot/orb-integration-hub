# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build GraphQL API Foundation with AppSync
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core GraphQL API using AWS AppSync with comprehensive schema definition, resolvers, and data source connections to DynamoDB
# Details:
Create AWS AppSync GraphQL API with: 1) Complete schema definition for User, Role, Application, and Permission entities based on YAML schemas, 2) VTL resolvers for all CRUD operations with proper error handling, 3) DynamoDB data sources with optimized table design including GSIs for query patterns, 4) Subscription support for real-time updates, 5) Authorization rules using Cognito User Pools and API keys, 6) Request/response mapping templates for data transformation. Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities. Configure CloudWatch logging for all resolver executions.

# Test Strategy:
GraphQL schema validation tests, resolver unit tests with mock DynamoDB responses, integration tests for all queries and mutations, subscription testing for real-time functionality, authorization testing for different user roles, performance testing for complex queries
